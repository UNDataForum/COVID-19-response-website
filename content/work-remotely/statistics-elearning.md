a substantial number of statisticians not being able to travel and working from
home, e-learning is probably the best tool for continued learning and acquiring
new skills. Many international agencies, regional training institutes and
national statistical offices are providing e-learning courses and other learning
materials. This can be difficult to navigate, however, not knowing who provides
what. An online gateway was therefore recently launched which is meant to help
in navigating available courses: https://www.unsdglearn.org/statistics/.
Different agencies are there providing key information of their courses and a
link to their own pages where one can register for the course in question.

The page offers various navigation opportunities; by SDGs, by statistical
domains and type of learning. Micro learning-courses are currently available on
the general learning page and are under development for the statistics page.
Courses from many actors are still missing, but more and more will become
available.

The landing page was initiated by the Global Network of Institutions for
Statistical Training (GIST). GIST is a network of international and regional
training institutions, as well as a selection of countries, which provide
statistical training to jointly build sustainable statistical capacities through
efficient, effective, and harmonized delivery of training. GIST has in the last
year been working on three main topics:

1. How to better address needs of statistical offices in a coordinated manner
2. Online gateway and e-community of practice and
3. Statistical literacy.
