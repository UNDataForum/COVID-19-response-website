  The OECD created a protected digital workspace to provide experts with the
  possibility to discuss problems and solutions or seek advice in a simple and
  pragmatic way. The workspace is a collaborative effort with logistics being
  managed by the OECD Secretariat, and participation of several international
  organizations, among which the United Nations (UN), the United National

The OECD created a protected
[digital workspace](https://community.oecd.org/community/official-stats-workspace-covid19)
to provide experts with the possibility to discuss problems and solutions or
seek advice in a simple and pragmatic way. The workspace is a collaborative
effort with logistics being managed by the OECD Secretariat, and participation
of several international organizations, among which the United Nations (UN), the
United National Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the European Central
Bank (ECB), the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), PARIS21 and
others.

The COVID-19 crisis has significant impact on the compilation and dissemination
of official statistics: lockdowns in many countries and teleworking have
affected face-to-face surveys of households, price collection, enterprise
surveys to name just a few areas of source data. Methodological and conceptual
questions may arise in national accounts, balance of payments, government
statistics or business statistics. At the same time, there is huge user demand
for early estimates to enable assessment of the economic and social impact of
the crisis. In trying to deal with these issues at the national level, many
national experts have voiced the need to exchange practices and experiences at
the international level.

**The OECD is hosting a digital workspace to allow experts from all national
statistical offices and central banks, to exchange information and ideas in a
simple, protected and pragmatic way**, for instance on innovative approaches to
counter the impact of missing source data; short-cuts to approximate economic
and societal developments; methodological and conceptual problems; (new) ways of
addressing user demands; impact on the timeliness of statistics, etc.

The digital workspace is organised as a **concerted effort of relevant
international organisations** including the OECD, the UNSD, UN-ECE, the Bank for
International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, the International Labour Organization and PARIS21. The following,
non-exhaustive, list of official statistics has been included in the workspace:

- Short-term statistics
- National accounts
- Prices
- Business statistics
- Balance of payments and foreign trade
- Household surveys, including labour force surveys
- Censuses

The format of the digital workspace is **simple and flexible to avoid any
additional burden** on national statistical agencies. For example, no
standardised information will be requested via questionnaires, etc., and the
exchanges will be demand-driven. The workspace is accessible only to those
registered from national statistical agencies and relevant international
organisations, thus providing a secure environment for statisticians to conduct
discussions in an open and transparent way. The workspace will be open for
registration to all countries worldwide.

For each theme, discussions on the workspace will be moderated by one or several
moderators. The role of moderators will mainly consist of following the
discussions, looking for common issues which may require further investigation
and advice, finding ways to address these issues and liaising with relevant
expert groups or committees.

appropriate access rights.
