title: Conferencing in times of COVID-19

description:
  Many organizations around the world are finding themselves in a position of
  having to decide how to move forward on planned conferences and meetings in
  the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This is the position that
  colleagues from the United Nations University Institute in Macau found
  themselves in with the 11th International Development Informatics Association
  conference (IDIA2020) planned for 25–27 March 2020. The organizing committee
  considered various options, including cancellation, postponement, or
  relocation (which was an option at the time), and ultimately decided on the
  virtual conference format.

Many organizations around the world are finding themselves in a position of
having to decide how to move forward on planned conferences and meetings in the
face of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This is the position that colleagues from
the [United Nations University Institute in Macau](https://cs.unu.edu/) found
themselves in with the
[11th International Development Informatics Association conference (IDIA2020)](https://www.idia2020.com/)
planned for 25–27 March 2020. The organizing committee considered various
options, including cancellation, postponement, or relocation (which was an
option at the time), and ultimately decided on the virtual conference format.

While this was the right and responsible decision to make, it was nonetheless
not an easy one, for several reasons:

1. Virtual conferences are not very common within the ICT4D academic community,
   and it was **difficult to anticipate the response** of the community.
1. There was a potential **loss of one of the key features** of academic
   conferencing - the networking and interaction between participants.
1. There were **inevitable technical challenges** (e.g., associated with
   Internet connectivity) that would affect some participants.
1. The team had **no experience** in organizing and hosting a virtual
   conference.
1. It meant **forfeiting the effort** that had already gone into the local
   organization of the conference.

Looking back at the recently concluded conference, not only was it the right and
responsible decision to go virtual, it was also the best decision as aptly and
eloquently articulated by one of the participants:

The following is what went in to making IDIA2020 a successful virtual conference
and what can be applied in other contexts.

## Plan

Extensive research went in to **deciding the right tools** to use for the
conference from among the many alternatives. This boiled down to the choice of
the conferencing platform as well as the audience engagement platform, which, in
our case, ended up being Zoom and Mentimeter, respectively.

It is essential to have **mitigation plans for known risks**. We set up four
levels of contingencies for the main risk of presenters having Internet
connection problems: (1) talk and slide-sharing by presenters, (2) talk by
presenters and slide-sharing by the Host, (3) telephone dial-in by presenters
and slide-share by the Host, and (4) pre-recording of the presentations. We also
considered and planned for some of the recently popularized risks associated
with the chosen tools.

**Roles and responsibilities** around the virtual conference need to be clearly
defined and rehearsed. For IDIA2020, the Host was responsible for managing
participants; a Co-host managed presentations, slide-sharing, as well as the
audience engagement platform, and session moderators (and stand-by moderators)
facilitated the discussions.

## Communicate

**Clear and timely communication**, before and during the virtual conference, is
essential because participants might not know what to expect and what is
expected of them. Share detailed information on house rules (e.g.,
muting/unmuting, Q&A arrangements) and also share the program (available in
multiple timezones).

## Improvise

It is essential to recognize and accept that **the unexpected will happen** and
that solutions will need to be improvised on the spot. Having well-defined roles
and responsibilities and clear team communication is essential. We set up a
“control center” for IDIA2020, which helped the hosting team to work together to
resolve issues as they occurred.

## Let go

There is a **temptation to hang-on to the usual and the traditional** aspects of
a physical conference and to try and force those into the virtual conference
format. While some elements can and must persist in the virtual (see the next
point), some things work well only in face-to-face engagements. For IDIA2020, we
had to let go of some of the planned interactive workshops. Unfortunately, a few
of our participants were also not keen to continue with the virtual format.

## Hang on

A common practice in conferences is the participant group photo, typically at
the end of the conference. For IDIA2020, while the virtual format gave a new
twist to the group photo, it gave the participants something familiar and
expected. This and other **such practices are necessary to hang on to**, and if
necessary, to **adapt accordingly**.

In conclusion, to borrow from Shakespeare, "There is a tide in the affairs of
men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune … On such a full sea are we
now afloat." The COVID-19 pandemic, like many other global challenges, is
providing us with an opportunity to reimagine our world and to improvise,
innovate, and adapt the way we live and do business. Sharing experiences and
expertise is a big part of leveraging such opportunities.
