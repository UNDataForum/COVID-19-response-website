  'Humanitarian Data Exchange: Making data accessible for the COVID-19 pandemic'

description:
  Access to open, interoperable and timely data about the COVID-19 pandemic is
  critical for understanding how the virus is spreading and the best strategies
  for responding in different contexts. To help, we have created a dedicated
  page on the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform so that our community
  can find COVID-19 related data from many sources and covering multiple
  countries.

Access to open, interoperable and timely data about the COVID-19 pandemic is
critical for understanding how the virus is spreading and the best strategies
for responding in different contexts. To help, we have created a
[dedicated page](https://data.humdata.org/event/covid-19) on the Humanitarian
Data Exchange (HDX) platform so that our community can find COVID-19 related
data from many sources and covering multiple countries.

The COVID-19 Pandemic page brings together dozens of datasets in
machine-readable formats, which are also available through the HDX API. Some of
the most notable contributions include:

- **WHO** —
  [COVID-19 Cases data for China and the rest of the World](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/coronavirus-covid-19-cases-data-for-china-and-the-rest-of-the-world)
  \(includes case numbers and fatalities\);
- **UNESCO** —
  [Global school closures](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-school-closures-covid19)
  \(includes number of children out of school by school type and gender\);
- **Johns Hopkins University** —
  [COVID-19 cases data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases)
  (compiled from multiple official sources);

  (compiled from multiple official sources);

  health, and more);

  healthcare capacity, and physical/sexual violence);

  (public health measures in place in different jurisdictions);
- **IOM** —
  [Country point of entry mobility restriction](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/country-point-of-entry-mobility-restriction-covid-19-iom-dtm) -
  COVID-19 (restrictions at specific airport, land border points, sea border
  points, and internal transit points);

We are calling on partners to share or help source data that is critical but
often missing including: data on the location of health and education
facilities, food insecurity and malnutrition rates, and transportation routes
and mobility patterns.

In parallel to our work on data sharing, the members of the Inter-Agency
Standing Committee Sub-Group on Data Responsibility (co-led by the Centre, IOM,
and UNHCR) have developed an
[FAQ](https://centre.humdata.org/faq-on-data-responsibility-in-the-covid-19-response/)
to support staff around the world working with COVID-19 related data. The
ongoing response presents a range of challenges and opportunities around the
safe, ethical, and effective management of data. This resource will be updated
regularly as we receive additional questions and feedback.

Our work on the COVID-19 response would not be possible without the support of
our longstanding partners. Since HDX was launched in 2014, more than 250
national and international organisations have shared almost 18,000 datasets on
HDX. The data covers a variety of topics from data about the context in which a
humanitarian crisis is occurring and the needs of people affected by the crisis,
to data about the organisational response. More than 80,000 people visit HDX
every month.

If your organisation is interested in joining HDX, please register on the
platform or write to us at [hdx@un.org](mailto:hdx@un.org). We look forward to
working with you.
