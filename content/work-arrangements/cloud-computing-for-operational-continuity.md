title: Cloud computing for operational continuity and disaster recovery

Today, cloud computing stands out as a key element of an operatinal continuity
and disaster recovery plan for statistical organizations, particularly in the
face of the disruption national and global statistical systems caused by the
COVID-19 crisis.

Cloud computing has become increasingly common among statistical organizations
that do not have the hardware or personnel necessary to fully deploy software
applications onsite, or that need to test new software tools in the context of
pilot data-solutions projects. It is an approach focused on the delivery, over
the internet, of software, infrastructure and platform services hosted by a
third party.

Due to its reliance on hardware-independent virtualization technology, cloud
computing enables organizations to quickly back up data, applications, and even
operating systems to a remote data center, and to deploy them to multiple users
distributed in many different locations.

Cloud computing includes the implementation of a “software as a service” (SaaS)
model, in which commonly used software applications are hosted on the cloud by a
third-party provider and made available to users over the Internet, usually
through a web browser. An advantage to this approach is that staff members that
need to work remotely do not have to install or configure anything, as the
underlying cloud hardware is maintained by the service provider.

In order to leverage cloud computing for disaster recovery and business
continuity, statistical organizations need to establish an IT architecture
characterized by the "containerization" of workflows and data flows, so that
computing resources can more easily and securely be switched over to a cloud
computing environment and remain operational.

Some examples of critical software applications that could leverage commercially
available SaaS solutions include:

- Email, videoconferencing, and other basic communication tools
- File sharing and team collaboration.
- Human resource management
- Management of relationships with data providers
- Management or relationships with data users
- Specialized applications (e.g., statistical analysis software, GIS
  applications)
- E-Learning delivery

A large number of commercial SaaS providers offer flexible, on-demand pricing
arrangements as well as tools for user management and data migration. However,
moving systems currently hosted on-premises to cloud services is a very complex
task that requires:

- Vendor selection and procurement
- Data cleaning and migration
- Addressing user management and authentication issues
