one country or sector can overcome COVID-19 alone: this deadly pandemic requires
swift and coordinated multi-stakeholder collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Numerous data collaboratives and partnerships are happening beyond the official
UN system. The [Governance Lab](http://www.thegovlab.org/) has created a
[living repository for data collaboratives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JWeD1AaIGKMPry_EN8GjIqwX4J4KLQIAqP09exZ-ENI/edit)
with the aim to build a responsible infrastructure for data-driven pandemic
response.

The living repository includes a list of ongoing data collaborative projects, as
well as requests for data and expertise and information on data competitions,
challenges, and calls for proposals, which can lead to useful tools to combat
COVID-19.

The aim is to include projects that show a commitment to privacy protection,
data responsibility, and overall user well-being. It will be updated regularly
as
[GovLab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JWeD1AaIGKMPry_EN8GjIqwX4J4KLQIAqP09exZ-ENI/edit)
receives projects and proposals or otherwise becomes aware of them. Individuals
are encouraged to edit the below and/or suggest additions to the repository.
