Impact of COVID-19 on the 2020 Census Round Population and census programmes are
complex data collection operations comprising a series of many interrelated
activities. They require contacting and collecting information on the whole
population of a country within a limited period of time.

operations, disrupting data collection, processing, analysis and dissemination
activities carried out by National Statistical Offices, forcing them to rapidly
develop and adopt alternative ways of implementing them.
