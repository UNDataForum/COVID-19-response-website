As the world tackles the spread of COVID-19 and its unprecedented impacts on
economies, societies and the environment, we are all stepping into unknown
territory. Everybody, from politicians to parents, from newly unemployed workers
to nurses, from supermarket cashiers to schoolchildren in front of computer
screens, faces great uncertainty. But not everything is unknown. We can arm
ourselves with facts to navigate through this uncertainty, guiding decisions and
informing plans.

National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and other producers of official statistics
are a key source of such facts. Against the onslaught of data from all kinds of
sources, official statistics bear the hallmarks of accuracy, reliability,
independence, transparency and rigour that make them trustworthy. And now more
than ever official statistics have a crucial role to play to ensure that major,
life-changing decisions are based on the best available information. When human
lives are at stake it is essential to have sound evidence to protect them. Good
data literally saves lives. The Statistics Divisions of the
[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA)](https://unstats.un.org/home/),
the
[Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)](https://www.unece.org/stats/stats_h.html),
the
[Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (UNESCWA)](https://www.unescwa.org/our-work/statistics),
the [Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)](https://www.uneca.org/acs),
[Economic and Social Comimssion for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)](https://www.unescap.org/our-work/statistics)
and
[Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)](https://www.cepal.org/en/work-areas/statistics)
are united in their efforts to support NSOs to keep on producing such
information. NSOs are under great pressure, both to keep producing the usual
statistics upon which we depend on a daily basis, such as employment, prices and
inflation, births and deaths, and to provide new and rapid information on
matters directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many NSOs need support to develop very quickly the new skills and competencies
required of their staff to deal with sudden and unprecedented challenges,
including using new methods to collect, process and analyze data while working
from home. To find out more about these urgent needs, the
[Statistics Division of UN DESA](https://unstats.un.org/home/) (UNSD) and the
[World Bank’s Development Data Group](https://data.worldbank.org/about), in
cooperation with the Statistical Divisions of the five United Nations Regional
Commissions, conducted a
[global survey on the state of statistical operations under the COVID-19 Pandemic ](/statistical-programmes/covid19-nso-survey/).
The information gathered will help to better understand disruptions in national
statistical activities in order to take effective mitigation actions and to
guide the planning for longer-term support provided by donors and the global
data and statistics community.

[A dedicated website](https://covid-19-response.unstatshub.org/) launched by the
UNSD in collaboration with partners from civil society and the private sector
showcases the official statistics community’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Supporting countries to join a
[federated network of COVID-19 data hubs](https://covid-19-data.unstatshub.org/),
UNSD is promoting the value of sharing open data resources in an interoperable
web-GIS environment.

Meanwhile around the world, each regional commission is supporting the NSOs of
its member countries in a range of ways to respond to the pandemic and the
statistical challenges it brings.

In the **UNECE** region, covering Europe, North America and Western Asia,
encompassing many of the countries currently worst hit by the crisis, a
[dynamic wiki-based platform](https://statswiki.unece.org/x/NYmSE) is enabling
statisticians to share experiences in all domains of statistics, such as
economic, social and demographic, as well as gathering country case studies of
responses to the disaster.

In the **Western Asia** region, a
[survey of member countries’ NSOs](https://data.unescwa.org/) revealed large
impacts on field work and dissemination.

In **Africa**, a similar
[quick assessment of NSOs](https://www.uneca.org/publications/quick-assessment-impact-covid-19-pandemic-africa-national-statistical-offices)
in the region is informing responses, including an online seminar on
[data collection for consumer price indices](https://www.uneca.org/regional-seminar-cpi)
during the pandemic, a conference to assess the impact of COVID-19 on civil
registration and vital statistics (CRVS), and an enhanced focus on
non-traditional data sources and digital technology.

The **Asia and the Pacific** region has launched a dedicated
[COVID-19 policy response website](https://www.unescap.org/covid19/policy-responses),
a
[Stats Café](https://www.unescap.org/announcement/asia-pacific-stats-caf-series)
series, guidance notes on various topics (including
[geospatially-enabled population estimates](https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Stats_Brief_Issue24_Apr2020_Why_reliable_and_timely_population_statistics_are_more_important.pdf)
and
[conducting surveys under lockdown](https://www.unescap.org/resources/stats-brief-april-2020-issue-no-23-surveys-under-lockdown-pandemic-lesson)),
and a virtual
[Asia-Pacific Statistics Week](https://www.unescap.org/events/asia-pacific-statistics-week-2020)
conference, and is now developing plans for this year’s
[Asia-Pacific Committee on Statistics](https://www.unescap.org/intergovernmental-meetings/committee-statistics-seventh-session)
in light of the COVID-19 crisis.

Initiatives in **Latin America and the Caribbean** include a
[regional COVID-19 observatory](https://www.cepal.org/en/topics/covid-19), a
website on
[contingency plans and recommendations for statistical production](https://rtc-cea.cepal.org/en/conectados-rtc/covid-19-contingency-plans-of-the-national-statistical-offices),
(which includes, among other content, 12 online seminars on the impact on
different statistical products), and a seminar on
[geospatial responses to the crisis](https://www.cepal.org/en/events/virtual-seminar-covid-19-strategies-geospatial-response-americas),
as well as guidance notes on
[producing price indices](https://www.cepal.org/es/publicaciones/45463-la-elaboracion-indice-precios-al-consumidor-ipc-la-emergencia-covid-19-america),
[conducting household surveys](https://www.cepal.org/es/publicaciones/45372-recomendaciones-la-publicacion-estadisticas-oficiales-partir-encuestas-hogares),
[treating selection bias](https://www.cepal.org/en/publications/45553-recommendations-eliminating-selection-bias-household-surveys-during-coronavirus)
and the
[compilation of national accounts](https://www.cepal.org/es/publicaciones/45666-compilacion-estadisticas-cuentas-nacionales-balanza-pagos-comercio-exterior)
during lockdowns.

The global official statistics community, like many other sectors, is facing
challenges that are unprecedented—but statisticians are prepared. In recent
years, the UN has developed tools to better define the roles of National
Statistical Systems in managing disaster risk and in producing the necessary
statistics, such as the
[UNECE Conference of European Statisticians](https://www.unece.org/stats/extreme.html)’
[Recommendations on the Role of Official Statistics in Measuring Hazardous Events and Disasters](https://www.unece.org/stats/extreme.html)
and the Asia-Pacific
[Disaster-related Statistics Framework](https://communities.unescap.org/asia-pacific-expert-group-disaster-related-statistics/content/drsf).
The current COVID-19 disaster calls all NSOs to put this guidance into practice,
while learning from the current challenges to ensure they are better prepared
for future crises. By gathering and disseminating the experiences of National
Statisticsl Systems across the world as they respond and adapt to the challenges
of the pandemic, the UN is facilitating the sharing of new insights and helping
all countries draw lessons from one-another’s successes and shortcomings.

The pandemic follows different trajectories in each world region, and there are
important differences in development of statistical systems across the world.
Yet, many of the challenges are shared by all, which makes a coordinated
response crucially important. The statistical offices of the Department of
Social and Economic Affairs and the five Regional Commissions are therefore
working together to live up to the name of the United Nations, uniting behind
the need for facts to guide us all out of this pandemic and beyond.
