Since it erupted onto the world stage, the novel coronavirus has exacted a heavy
toll, with more than 6 million cases worldwide and nearly 400,000 deaths from
COVID-19 as of this writing. Much of the world remains on lockdown, adding loss
of livelihood and financial suffering to the grave health impacts of the virus.

National statistical systems have not been exempt from the ravages of the
disease. At a time when the need for high-quality, timely data is more urgent
than ever, national statistical systems have been hobbled by restrictions on
face-to-face survey interviewing due to social and physical distancing measures.
Nonetheless, governments, civil society, and the general public are increasingly
turning to national statistical organizations (NSOs) for reliable data to
understand the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. NSOs are
also playing a critical role of validation and quality assurance across the
statistical system, given the steady demand for more and newer data as we try to
adjust to this ‘new normal’.

In the midst of this crunch, the
[Statistical Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](http://unstats.un.org/)
and the [World Bank's Development Data Group](http://data.worldbank.org/), in
coordination with the five UN regional commissions, launched a global online
survey to monitor the nature, scale, and scope of the impact of the coronavirus
crisis on statistical agencies, as well as to identify new data needs. The
survey was designed to inform the global statistical community on how to better
respond to immediate needs of support to countries facing the most urgent
challenges, and plan a coordinated effort as we navigate through the crisis and
its impact over the next few months. A second wave of the survey will be
launched later this month.

The survey results, covering the 122 countries that responded to the
questionnaire, are summarized in a report available on the UN Statistical
Division
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UNStats/covid-19-response/master/static/covid19-nso-survey-report.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UNStats/covid-19-response/master/static/covid19-nso-survey-report.pdf)
and the [World Bank Group websites](http://data.worldbank.org/), clearly
underscore the tremendous challenges faced by national statistical organizations
as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. The results also include information on the
measures being taken by statistical agencies to mitigate negative impacts and
meet new data demands, as well the areas that require priority support from
partners. Here are three key messages that stand out to us from the data.

Here are three key messages that stand out to us from the data.

First, the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating global data inequalities, as
statistical agencies in countries with the least resources are also those facing
the greatest challenges in coping with the crisis, let alone adapting data
collection operations to this new reality. Among other things, the pandemic has
impacted the operations of the vast majority of national statistical offices,
requiring office closures, telework and the suspension of face-to-face
interviews. 65 percent of NSO headquarters offices are partially or fully
closed, 90 percent have instructed staff to work from home, and 96 percent have
partially or fully stopped face-to-face data collection.

Statistical operations have been hardest hit in low- and lower middle-income
countries, while more resourced statistical systems in East Asia, Europe, and
North America have largely been able to protect their essential operations. Nine
out of ten NSOs in low- and lower middle-income countries saw the pandemic blunt
their ability to meet international reporting requirements, as opposed to one in
two NSOs in high-income countries. The report details similar trends in the
production of essential monthly or quarterly statistics, the production of
administrative data statistics, and survey operations, where NSOs in Easter and
South-Eastern Asia, Europe and Northern America, and Oceania have been
relatively less affected.

Second, the global statistical community and donors must urgently provide
technical assistance and financial resources to the national statistical offices
most in need of support. We find that nine in ten national statistical offices
in low- and lower middle-income countries are facing difficulties operating
during the pandemic due to funding constraints, as more than half have seen
funding cuts. 73 NSOs – 61 percent of those responding to this question in the
survey – stated the need for additional external support to face the challenges
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Priority areas for support in this group
of countries include technical assistance and capacity building, financial
support, and software for remote data collection.

Finally, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of the digital revolution,
while reaffirming ‘traditional’ data collection as the backbone of national data
systems. Despite the many disruptions caused by the pandemic, national
statistical offices are taking up the mantle of responding to the new data needs
and demands. We find that the majority of NSOs are implementing surveys on
COVID-19 and its impacts, and are either planning or setting up national
platforms to address the data needs of their government and citizens. To monitor
and assess the impacts of COVID-19, in lieu of face-to-face surveys, statistical
offices around the world have been relying on alternative data collection modes
and data sources, most prominently phone surveys (58 percent) and administrative
data (53 percent), in addition to online surveys (34 percent). However, as
highlighted in the report, NSOs in low- and lower middle-income countries rely
significantly less often on remote sensing and satellite imagery, revealing
technology and infrastructure deficits that must be addressed by donors during
this fraught time.

The UN system and the World Bank, in coordination with the UN regional
commissions, intend to continue monitoring the situation in the coming months
through multiple follow-up rounds to this survey. The feedback we receive from
NSOs will be critical in helping us better support our statistical partners, as
the global statistical community continue to play its vital role in informing
all sectors of society during this unprecedented crisis. We are committed to
supporting countries to turn this crisis into an opportunity to invest smartly
in more resilient and modernized integrated data/statistical systems.
