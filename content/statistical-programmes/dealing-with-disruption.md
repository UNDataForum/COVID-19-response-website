As various global restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic continue, so do
disruptions to the operations of National Statistical Offices. This comes at a
time when data remain key to inform evidence-based policymaking that addresses
the manifold public health, economic, and social challenges countries face.

While a crucial role has accrued to National Statistical Offices (NSOs) in
supporting government action, navigating the restrictions the pandemic imposes
on their operation has brought about new challenges for them. To understand
these new challenges and NSOs’ needs, the
[Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://covid-19-response.unstatshub.org/statistical-programmes/covid19-nso-survey/)
and the
[World Bank's Development Data Group](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/survey-of-national-statistical-offices-nsos-during-covid-19)
in coordination with the five UN regional commissions, just released the results
of the third round of a global online survey to monitor the impact of the
coronavirus crisis on NSOs.

The
[first round](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/covid-19-widens-gulf-global-data-inequality-while-national-statistical-offices-step-up)
of the survey, released in June, highlighted the heavy impact of the crisis on
NSOs that nonetheless were stepping up to new data demands. The
[second round](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/coping-pandemic-crisis-what-do-national-statistical-offices-need-most),
published in August, in turn, identified a crucial need for better coordination
and technical assistance to avoid further exacerbation of global data
inequalities.

Now, findings from the
[third round](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/833751608029512958/pdf/Monitoring-the-State-of-Statistical-Operations-under-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-Highlights-from-the-Third-Round-of-a-Global-COVID-19-Survey-of-National-Statistical-Offices-NSOs.pdf)
of the survey, completed in October with 125 countries participating, give a
glimpse of the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on NSOs’ operations.

Here are some key findings from the latest report:

- Overall, **current disruptions to NSOs’ operations continue at similar levels
  found in in July** suggesting long-lasting impacts. While the proportion of
  NSOs whose main offices are open to staff has marginally increased in this
  period, remote work continues to be the global norm. Two-thirds of NSOs still
  instruct at least some staff to work from home. Furthermore, little progress
  has been made in returning to face-to-face data collection.

</Box>

- However, **there are considerable differences among NSOs from countries with
  different income levels in their ability to return to normal operations.**
  Large disparities are reflected, for example, in working-from-home
  arrangements. While in low and lower-middle income countries, 44 percent of
  NSOs that responded to the survey have not instructed their staff to work from
  home, this is only the case in 24 percent of NSOs in high income countries.
  Moreover, most NSOs still cannot estimate a timeframe for their return to
  face-to-face data collection. Almost three-quarters of NSOs in high income
  countries and over two-thirds of those in upper-middle income countries
  consider it hard to say when this will be the case. Conversely, over half of
  NSOs in low and lower-middle income countries expect to resume in-person
  interviews within the next three months.

- As disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic did not dissipate in the second
  half of 2020, **many NSOs decided on long-term postponements of their planned
  censuses.** Forty percent of NSOs with a planned population and housing census
  for 2020 or 2021 stated that they had to postpone data collection operations.
  Disruptions are particularly widespread among low and lower-middle income
  countries where 68 percent had to postpone the census, roughly half of which
  to after 2021. In contrast, only 24 percent of NSOs in high income countries
  that had plans to conduct a population and housing census had to postpone its
  original schedule.

- **NSOs are developing new fieldwork protocols to collect data under
  COVID-conditions.** Slightly more than half of surveyed NSOs have already
  developed new protocols such as updated guidelines for travelling, contacting
  respondents, conducting interviews, and practicing social distancing. Among
  those without new protocols, almost eight in ten NSOs would consider it useful
  if such protocols were developed in the future. Interest in the future
  elaboration of new protocols is particularly high in low and middle-income
  countries highlighting a crucial area for support through the international
  community. Out of the countries with new protocols, 43 percent signaled their
  willingness to share them with other countries. The
  [Intersecretariat Working Group on Household Surveys](https://unstats.un.org/iswghs/task-forces/covid-19-and-household-surveys/)
  has been working on a technical note providing practical guidance for planning
  and implementing household surveys under COVID-19 which is going to be
  published on their website.

- **NSOs are heavily involved in collecting data to track the spread and the
  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in many cases forming partnerships to do
  so.** Among all NSOs interviewed, 82 percent are involved in collecting data
  on COVID-19 and its impacts. Notably, approximately 9 in 10 respondents from
  Sub-Saharan Africa and in Northern Africa and Western Asia (SDG region
  corresponding to MENA) indicated their offices are planning or already
  implementing efforts to collect data on COVID-19 and its impacts. These
  efforts have been supported through partnerships with international or public
  sector partners and, somewhat less frequently, private sector partners.
  International partnerships account for the highest share in low and
  middle-income countries, while public sector partnerships are predominant in
  their highincome counterparts.

As 2020 draws to a close, disruptions to NSOs continue and challenge them to
step up to meet new data demands. To fulfill their critical role during the
crisis, NSOs have shown adaptability by developing new protocols, forming new
partnerships, and tapping into new technologies, data sources, and methods.
However, there is no doubt that more technical support and collaboration is
required to ensure data production continues. Particularly in low and
lower-middle income countries where financial and technological resources are
scarcer and access to administrative data sources is less developed,
international partners play an important role. Here, a concerted effort by the
international community focused on NSOs' needs will be key in order to
transition to more resilient statistical systems.

An additional round of data collection is planned to take place in January 2021,
and the results will be disseminated in March.
