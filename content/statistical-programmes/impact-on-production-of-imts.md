  Assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 on the production of International
  Merchandise Trade Statistics
date: 2020-04-10
---

The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) inquired through an informal email
consultation with our regional partners whether the COVID-19 pandemic had
impacted the data production of International Merchandise Trade Statistics
(IMTS). Most regions reported that--so far--there is no interruption in data
production and transmission, at least until the reference period of
February 2020.

It was stated that export/import activities through airport/port continue and
the related basic customs data are expected to be submitted to statistical
agencies in a timely manner. However, the transformation of the basic customs
data into IMTS may be impacted in some countries as not all national statistical
agencies are appropriately equipped to support the staff in working from home.

Moreover, those regions that rely on enterprise survey data reported that the
data transmission for January/February 2020 may be delayed due to lack of
responses from the enterprises included in the sample. The regions also
responded that a prolonged quarantine/lockdown period may impact regular data
production in the future.

UNSD will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 and update this initial
assessment report for IMTS. As appropriate, UNSD will continue to provide
business continuity guidance and assistance to countries in preparing their IMTS
data.

  Statistics New Zealand publishes daily trade from 1 February to the most
  recent week. It compares 2020 values with those from previous years, to show
  the potential impacts of COVID-19 since its outbreak in late 2019. The
  original intent was to focus on New Zealand’s relationship with China, but as
  the impact is now worldwide, the coverage will be broadened with each release.

  The World Customs Organization (WCO) has issued a non-exhaustive list
  according to HS codes for medical supplies that should be particularly
  facilitated during the COVID-19 crisis. It consists of the following group of
  products:

  1. COVID-19 Test kits/ Instruments and apparatus used in Diagnostic Test
  2. Protective garments and the like
  3. Thermometers
  4. Disinfectants/Sterilization products
  5. Other medical devices such as Computed tomography (CT) scanners

  UN Comtrade is a repository of official international trade statistics and
  relevant analytical tables. Data users can query the latest monthly trade data
  with a month delay (as of today, data of February 2020 for several countries
  are already available). Thanks to timely monthly data, UN Comtrade can provide
  an early indication of COVID-19 impact on international trade. Besides, UN
  Comtrade offers Public Data API which enables automation of data extraction
  for further data analysis or transformation. Extended data items such as mode
  of transport or the second partner country are already accessible via the
  interface or API.
