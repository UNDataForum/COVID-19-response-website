The COVID-19 situation presents a double challenge for statistical offices:
increased demand for statistics to manage pandemic and its impacts, combined
with obstacles to collecting data and producing statistics. To help statistical
offices deal with the crisis, the
[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe](https://www.unece.org/info/ece-homepage.html)
has announced the launch of the
[UNECE platform on COVID-19 and official statistics](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/COV/Home).
The UNECE platform provides guidance in the areas of UNECE expertise and focuses
on the work done under the
[Conference of European Statisticians (CES)](https://www.unece.org/stats/ces.html).
As such, it complements information by other international organizations.

Maintained by the
[UNECE Statistical Division](https://www.unece.org/stats/stats_h.html), the
platform aims to provide advice, sources and a discussion forum, and includes
guidance in the following areas:

- [Support for managing the crisis](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/COV/Support+for+managing+the+crisis)--a
  collection of case studies is underway on how statistical offices provide data
  and other support to their governments in dealing with the crisis and
  assessing its impacts;
- How to collect data and continue production of statistics in the areas of
  [social and demographic statistics](https://statswiki.unece.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=278039009)
  (e.g. how to run a population census);
  [economic statistics](https://statswiki.unece.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=278039015)
  (e.g. how to deal with calculation of CPI and GDP), and
  [cross-cutting and managerial issues](https://statswiki.unece.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=278039020)
  (e.g. usage of mobile positioning data).

The platform is a living resource and will be continuously updated with new
material. For example, various COVID-19 related issues will be discussed at the
Conference of European Statisticians (CES) plenary session on 22-24 June 2020.
It includes links to relevant guidance produced by other international
organizations. Under the
[Related initiatives](https://statswiki.unece.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=278039025)
section, we provide a link to related platforms of our major partners, such as
Eurostat, OECD, UNSD, IMF, ILO, and selected regional commissions.

UNECE welcomes comments to the discussion fora under each area, as well as
submission of examples, innovative solutions or other material that could be
shared with statistical offices. Visit UNECE platform on COVID-19 and official
