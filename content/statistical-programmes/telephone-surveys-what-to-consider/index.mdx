Under the current COVID-19 crisis, what can we learn from our past experience in
collecting information through telephone interviews, when person-to-person
interview is not possible? This note provides a few points for statistical
organizations to consider when deciding whether to adopt such an approach.

Telephone surveys are a commonly used in market research and political polls.
Compared to the traditional face-to-face interviews, telephone interview is
usually less costly as household visits are not necessary. Telephone interview
has also been used in official statistics, in different ways. Some official
surveys are implemented as telephone survey only, for example the annual
[American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/) is implemented through
computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Telephone interviewing can also
be implemented as one part of the entire survey. For instance, the
[US National Crime Victimization Survey](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245)
keeps the selected households in the survey for 3.5 years and the interview is
conducted every 6 months. The first interview is conducted face-to-face,
followed by subsequent ones through telephone interview.

Telephone interview is also being used in situations where face-to-face
interview is not possible. For example,
[Rapid Emergency Response Surveys were conducted in a number of countries in Africa to assess the level of food security and poverty](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/informing-rapid-emergency-response-phone-surveys).
The surveys were designed as phone surveys and aimed to deliver rapid assessment
results.

## Objective of the survey

Is the use of telephone interviews being considered for a regular survey that
has been planned for face-to-face interview? Or the objective is to carry out a
small telephone interview to collect information that is related to COVID-19? In
the formar case, has the field work been partially completed before the
pandemic, with the telephone interview being introduced to continue with the
remaining households?

These questions will help framing the magnitude of the exercise. For example, a
subsample of a recent survey (such as Labour Force Survey, Demographic and
Health Survey or Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey) might be fine to collect
data for topics related to COVID-19. However it might not be sufficient for
producing data on regular surveys by desired geographical breakdowns. The length
of a regular survey questionnaire might also be challenging for a telephone
interview.

## Sampling frame

As with sample selection for a person-to-person surveys, telephone surveys need
a frame to select the respondents, with each respondent associated with a known
selection probability.

[Random digit dialing (RDD)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/handbook/handbook-of-statistics/vol/29/part/PA)
is a method of probability sampling that provides a sample of households,
families, or persons via a random selection of their telephone numbers. A major
challenge for RDD surveys is developing a complete list of telephone numbers
that cover all target population in the country.

A relatively easier and reliable way of getting a list of representative
respondents through telephone is to use the telephone numbers collected from a
recent household survey in the country. This was done in the
[high frequency cell phone surveys carried out in Sierra Leone after the Ebola crisis](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2695).
The survey followed a sample of households for whom cell phone numbers were
recorded during the nationally-representative Labour Force Survey conducted in
July-August 2014. One additional advantage of surveying households from a recent
survey is that similar characteristics can be collected in both surveys, thus
allowing a comparison of situations before and after the pandemic.

## Steps to increase response rate

Many respondents may be reluctant to respond to an unknown caller which could
lead to a low response rate and potential biases in responses. Potential steps
which could be taken to counter-act this is to
[send out a SMS message in advance of calling](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150231),
specifying that the agency running the survey will call at a specific point in
time and that all information received will be handled confidentially. Links to
the webpage of the survey and contact information could also be provided.
Further, as with other data collection, information campaigns could take place
to make people aware.

## Interview protocol

Will the survey allow proxy response when one of the household members can
respond to the interview on behalf of other household members? If only
self-reporting is allowed, guidance needs to be provided on protocols to follow,
such as the number of callbacks allowed to reach the designated respondent.

## Targeted area

Is there a specific geographic area(s) that the survey would like to target?
Will the survey cover areas that are affected differently by the pandemic? The
first round of the Sierra Leone High Frequency survey produced estimates for
three broad areas that were affected differently by Ebola. If estimates are to
be produced for different regions, representativeness of each needs to be
considered.

## Questionnaire length

The questionnaire should be short (20-30 minutes) for telephone interview, for
various reasons. (Refer to
[here](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030251192) for more information)
Weak connectivity of phone network in some areas often make long interviews
difficult. Respondents also tend to have a shorter attention span over the phone
than in the face-to-face interview.

## Questionnaire content

It is a difficult task to balance between the short duration of an interview and
the amount of information that the survey would like to cover. Basic
sociodemographic characteristics should always be covered. If following directly
after a recent survey and using a subset of the sample in that survey, it is
preferred to use similar question formulation if the same topic is covered. This
facilitates comparison across surveys and allows studies comparing the
situations before and after the pandemic. It is important to note that, however,
there may be questions which work well face-to-face but are not suitable for
telephone interviewing. These may include questions that use showcards or have a
long list of response options. For example, when asking about income sources, a
face-to-face survey might present a showcard with a list of options on and ask
respondents to mention all that apply to them. By telephone, a better approach
would probably be to ask about each of the potential income sources one by one
as a series of questions.

## Telephone-interview specific training

There are specific training elements that need to be taken into consideration
for telephone interview. For example, telephone interview is more challenging
for enumerators to build rapport with respondent. Therefore carefully prepared
introductory text is very important. More information on the topic is available
[here](http://www.ccsg.isr.umich.edu/).

## Electronic data capture/data centre

Data collected in survey operations will be captured eventually by a central
database. For countries that have been implementing CAPI such database exists
already. However for countries using PAPI in their data collection, decisions
need to be made on how data collected through telephone interview will be
recorded and stored. It is still possible to have enumerators recording
responses on paper questionnaire and then transferred to a database later on but
is not desirable. However, if a large proportion of field work on paper
questionnaire has already been completed, recording the remaining responses on
paper questionnaires can be considered. More guidance on setting up a data
centre is available online.

## Quality assessment

As in all data collection exercises, quality of the telephone survey needs to be
assessed and clearly documented. In cases when telephone interview is introduced
to cope with the Covid-19 challenge, the impact of interview mode change needs
to be studied.
