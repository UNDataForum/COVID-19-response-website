The World Bank and the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), in
coordination with the five UN Regional Commissions, are conducting a global
online survey to assess the impact of the coronavirus crisis on statistical
offices, and to identify needs for financial and technical support.

### Phase 3 - Survey conducted in December 2020

This report presents the results of the third round of a global survey on the
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of National Statistical
Offices (NSOs).1 The first round conducted in May 2020 focused on shedding light
on office closures and the disruptions to data collection as a consequence of
the pandemic. The second round, rolled out in July 2020, looked at the extent to
which restrictions and disruptions had receded or become more widespread. The
third round, carried out in October 2020, is focused on how NSOs have adapted to
the new reality by implementing new surveys, developing new protocols for
face-to-face data collection, and by building new partnerships. The
questionnaire also contained questions on Population Census operations and
economic statistics, proposed by the International Committee on Census
Coordination (ICCC) and the Friend of the Chair (FoC) Group on Economic
Statistics, respectively.

**Key findings:**

- Most of the National Statistical Offices (NSOs) have at least partially
  reopened since the initial closure in March-April. Only 2 percent of the NSOs
  were still closed to all staff as of October 2020.
- Globally, about a quarter of NSOs had no restrictions to face-to-face data
  collection,but there were large regional differences.
- Seventy-three percent of NSOs had a Population and Housing Census planned in
  2020 or 2021 before the pandemic hit. In the low and lower-middle income
  group, 68 percent of the NSOs that were planning a census had to postpone it.
- Half of NSOs have developed new written fieldwork protocols for face-to-face
  interviews, while most of the remaining NSOs would consider it useful to have
  this type of guidelines for their survey operations.
- NSOs remained heavily involved in tracking the spread and the impact of the
  COVID-19 pandemic.
- NSOs are engaging in new partnerships to bridge the data gaps created by the
  pandemic. The main challenge in establishing new partnerships with public or
  private sector partners has been in formalizing the institutional
  collaborative arrangements.
- Many NSOs have taken on a data stewardship role, coordinating with government
  or national agencies, especially on data quality and data sharing agreements.
- The use of geospatial information and technologies has not been mainstreamed
  yet in COVID-19 related data collection in most NSOs, with the majority of
  NSOs in low and lower-middle countries expressing clear needs to build
  analytical capacity and infrastructure in this area.

### Phase 2 - Survey conducted in July 2020

The second round of the survey in July 2020 looked at how restrictions and
disruptions have receded or become more widespread over time, and at national
and international coordination in responding to data challenges posed by the
pandemic.

</Box>

**Key findings:**

- Since the last survey in May, most NSOs have gradually moved towards office
  reopening and returning to face-to-face data collection, but working from home
  has become the new normal for many. New protocols are needed to operate more
  efficiently under this new environment. Some of the best practices and lessons
  learned should be scaled up.
- Remote work, training, data collection, and data storage are vital for NSOs to
  operate during the pandemic but many, particularly in low- and middle-income
  countries, are constrained by inadequate ICT equipment and infrastructure.
  This calls for more decisive investments in digital technology.
- Short-term statistical production, which rely heavily on traditional
  face-to-face methods, continues to be affected, with low- and middle-income
  countries impacted the most. Reliance on alternative data sources requires
  smart investments to build the right spectrum of skill sets amongst NSOâ€™s
  staff and NSS data producers.
- National and international coordination in the collection of data on the
  COVID-19 pandemic has been inadequate in some cases, especially in Sub-Saharan
  Africa. New institutions, or repurposing of existing institutions, with strong
  local ownership, may be needed to address these coordination problems and
  enhance effectiveness of individual efforts.
- The pandemic has highlighted the importance of digital data, while opening up
  new possibilities to strengthen and modernize core data collection programs as
  the backbone of national data systems.

### Phase 1 - Survey conducted in May 2020

The first round of the survey was implemented in May 2020 and focused on how the
COVID-19 pandemic has affected the general functioning of NSOs.

**Key findings:**

- The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating global data inequalities. Statistical
  agencies in countries with the least resources are facing the greatest
  challenges. The pandemic has impacted their operations: 65% of NSO
  headquarters are partially or fully closed, 90% have staff working from home,
  and 96% have stopped face-to-face data collection.
- Statistical operations have been hardest hit in low- and lower middle-income
  countries. 90% of NSOs in low- and lower middle-income countries are
  struggling to meet international reporting requirements, as opposed to one in
  two NSOs in high-income countries.
- Over 60% of NSOs indicated they need additional external support.
- NSOs are adapting and responding to the new data needs and demands of the
  COVID-19 pandemic and are using alternative methods, primarily phone surveys,
  administrative data and online surveys.
- The global statistical community and donors must urgently provide technical
  assistance and financial resources to those offices most in need of support.
- The pandemic has highlighted the importance of the digital data, while opening
  up new possibilities to strengthen and modernize core data collection programs
  as the backbone of national data systems.
