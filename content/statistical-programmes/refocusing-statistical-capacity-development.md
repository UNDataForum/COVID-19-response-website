As the ongoing global crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to
unfold, there is an increasing risk of less production and dissemination of
disaggregated, high quality foundational data in National Statistical Systems
(NSS) in developing and least-developed countries, already facing a capacity
squeeze. While those NSSs adjust their operations in the face of lockdowns and
other mitigation policies, policymakers and citizens need to take quick,
informed actions to tackle the crisis--ideally based on quality data accessible
to everyone. Consequently, the combination of rising demands and constrained
supply of official statistics reduces NSS capacity to contribute to response and
recovery activities.

In this context, private data producers, civil society organisations and
academia might step in and provide a complementary supply of data to
policymakers. In a crisis more than in any other time, NSSs thus need to reach
beyond their traditional mandate as a data producer, and engage in data
stewardship. Capacity development efforts should refocus on developing
coordination, governance and quality management capabilities.

# Recommendations and country examples

1. **Scale up teleworking arrangements:** Wherever possible, NSS institutions
   should work with policymakers and development partners to improve operational
   conditions for remote work. Without these capabilities, risks of critical
   data shortages will increase over time. Colombia (DANE) took early steps to
   ensure staff connectivity such as VPN access, free antivirus licenses and
   increased data-processing capacities.

2. **Accelerate innovation and digitalisation:** As opportunities for
   traditional, field-based approaches to data collection wane, National
   Statistical Offices (NSOs) and other NSS institutions should prioritise
   transitions to new technologies for official statistics. Senegal (ANSD) is
   pursuing options to replace field operations with phone and web-based survey
   production. Lesotho (NBS) solicited support from the World Bank to develop
   alternative approaches to census production using big data.

3. **Package existing data sources for decision-makers:** While options to
   collect new data are constrained, policymakers and partners can use existing
   data sources to develop evidence-based approaches to pandemic response and
   identify populations at greatest risk. The Dominican Republic (ONE) responded
   to data demands by establishing a central data repository of all information
   related to COVID-19 in their country. Maldives (NBS) is collaborating with
   UNDP to undertake a rapid livelihood assessment of populations most at risk
   in the context of the epidemic.

4. **Engage in the global debate and communicate to citizens:** Even under
   limited operational conditions, NSOs and other NSS institutions serve an
   important function in communicating trusted information to the public. It is
   thus essential to publish press releases, update the website and communicate
   information related to COVID-19 and its impact on data production and
   dissemination to the public. This might spur further opportunities of
   engagement.

5. **Strengthen mechanisms for collaboration and coordination:** NSOs and NSSs
   need act as the central data repository and advise policymakers on best
   response and recovery operations – as part of a crisis committee for example.
   To provide precise and actionable information, NSOs need to understand the
   government’s information requirements. Often existing coordination bodies
   could serve as a forum for exchange between institutions. Colombia (DANE)
   created an administrative data committee with members from the National
   Planning Department and the Ministry of ICT to understand the data needs of
   their policy makers.
