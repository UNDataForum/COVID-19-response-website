part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations Statistics
Division, in its role as Secretariat of the 2020 World Population and Housing
Census Programme, is compiling a country-by-country
[overview of the pandemicâ€™s impact on census-taking activities in the year 2020](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/census/COVID-19/).
This information is updated daily with details provided by the census managers
from countries.

Population and census programmes are complex data collection operations
comprising a series of many interrelated activities. They require contacting and
collecting information on the whole population of a country within a limited
period of time.

The COVID-19 crisis creates unprecedented and sudden challenges for countries
conducting population and housing censuses and other major statistical
operations, disrupting data collection, processing, analysis and dissemination
activities carried out by National Statistical Offices, forcing them to rapidly
develop and adopt alternative ways of implementing them.
