The COVID-19 pandemic presented a major challenge for household survey programs,
as the health risks posed by the virus and associated restrictions disrupted
traditional face-to-face survey operations in many countries. According to a
[survey on the impact of COVID-19 on national statistical offices](https://covid-19-response.unstatshub.org/statistical-programmes/covid19-nso-survey/)
conducted by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and the World Bank in
May 2020, 96 percent of National Statistical Offices (NSOs) had partially or
fully stopped face-to-face data collection.

Almost one year into this global crisis, many countries have seen a gradual
reopening of activities, which made the resumption in household survey
opera¬tions possible, either through partial or full face-to-face interviews by
the NSOs. As of October 2020, around 40 percent of NSOs that had fully or partly
halted face-to-face interviews were planning to resume them in full within the
next six months.

In response to a call by countries during the third round of the aforesaid NSO
survey, the
[Task Force on COVID-19 and Household Surveys](https://unstats.un.org/iswghs/task-forces/covid-19-and-household-surveys/)
– co-led by UNSD, the World Bank and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, under
the aegis of the Inter-Secretariat Working Group on Household Surveys – has
released new guidance on what to consider when planning to implement a
face-to-face survey, partially or fully, during the continuing COVID-19
pandemic.

The
[technical guidance note](https://unstats.un.org/iswghs/news/docs/COVID-19_TechnicalGNote_final.pdf)
focuses on considerations to help mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission
during survey field work, while maintaining, to the extent possible, continuity
in survey operations. The note covers all aspects of planning and implementation
– from assessing the country’s COVID-19 situation, choosing the appropriate data
collection mode and designing survey questionnaires, to fieldwork and
post-fieldwork recommendations – and is designed to be easily adapted under
fluctuating pandemic circumstances.

Three key principles underly the considerations in this note:

- Ensuring the continued availability of high-quality, timely and
  well-documented data for policymaking at the national and local level;
- Focusing on essential data by limiting field data collection activities to the
  minimum necessary;
- Minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission among household survey field
  staff and survey respondents in order to prevent further contagion.

Given the fluidity of the pandemic and understanding of how the virus affects
lives, the guidance stresses the importance for survey implementers to keep
their field work plan adaptable and agile, monitor the COVID-19 situation
continuously, update safety protocols if needed, and be prepared to adapt
quickly and halt fieldwork immediately, if necessary.

Included in the note are a set of practical tools to facilitate the work of
survey implementers, such as a reference checklist to guide decision-making
around all aspects of survey operation, a COVID-19 risk assessment questionnaire
for survey field staff and respondents, and a sample standard informed consent
script that make respondents aware of any risks of COVID-19 following the
fieldwork.

The note was prepared based on a review of available national guidance on survey
protocols for face-to-face interviewing during the COVID-19 period, as well as
relevant guidance from international and non-profit organizations.
