The COVID-19 pandemic is putting civil registration authorities under an
unprecedented level of stress, where the failure to register all vital events
may lead to serious difficulties in generating accurate and timely vital
statistics. In the framework of the UN Legal Identity Agenda (LIA)—a holistic
approach to civil registration, vital statistics and identity management
launched in May 2019 and officially endorsed in March 2020—, the UN Legal
Identity Task Force is working to assess the impact of COVID-19 on registration
of vital events and generating vital statistics, and helping countries address
these challenges.

The Task Force launched a
[short survey](https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/COVID-19/) in order
to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the functioning of civil
registration worldwide, provide information regarding national solutions and a
forum for exchange of experiences.

Building on the results of this survey, and with the support of UNECA, UNESCAP
and SPC, the UN Legal Identity Task force has also issued a set of
[recommendations](https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/documents/COVID-19-Guidelines.pdf)
for supporting the continuous and complete civil registration of vital events in
times of the pandemic. This document will be updated as needed, and the Task
Force welcomes suggestions sent via e-mail to
[un.lia@undp.org](mailto:un.lia@undp.org).

The
[UN Legal Identity Agenda Task Force](https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/)
was established in 2019 to promote and implement the United Nations Legal
Identity Agenda. It is co-chaired by the Statistics Division of the UN
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) and the United United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The UN
Economic Commission for Africa (UN ECA) and the UN Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) spearhead the implementation of UN
LIA in their respective regions.
