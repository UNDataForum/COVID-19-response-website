In an effort to contain the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, many governments
are imposing severe restrictions on the mobility of their populations,
disrupting field statistical data collection operations and threatening the
ability of National Statistical Offices to deliver high-quality, timely and
cost-effective statistical outputs.

It is imperative to leverage innovative technologies and approaches to ensure
the continuity of censuses, household surveys, and other major statistical
programmes. This includes making use, to the fullest extent possible, of mobile
connectivity, cloud computing, smart mobile devises, and other technological
innovations that offer alternative means to ensure that activities around the
capturing, validation, processing and dissemination of census and survey data
can go on in the new environment of limited mobility of staff and of the
population at large.

Priority objectives in the adaptation of data collection processes are:

- Maintaining adequate coverage of the target populations
- Ensuring high questionnaire- and item-response
- Guaranteeing overall quality of the data collected
- Maintaining timely data collection, processing and dissemination
- Minimizing response burden
- Using resources efficiently / minimizing cost of statistical operations

There is an urgent need to replace many of the current field data collection
operations that rely on face-to-face interviews with alternative remote data
collection methodologies, such as telephone personal interviewing or paper or
web-based self-reporting methods, or with methods that leverage alternative
sources of data, such as administrative records or so-called “big data” sources
\(e.g., remote sensing and earth observation, mobile phone records, scanner
data, credit card records, etc.\). To respond to this challenge, many countries
need to build quickly the necessary capacity to accelerate the implementation of
fully digital data collection technologies instead of traditional paper-based
methods.

Time is a key factor in selecting alternative data collection approaches to
ensure the continuity of statistical operations, including the estimated time
necessary to procure/develop, test and deploy technical solutions, and to train
staff in new skills and the use of new technologies.

It is also crucial to design and launch as quickly as possible a contact and
communication strategy towards respondents in the target population, aimed to
maximize high response rates in a new web-based or telephone-based data
collection setting. This include communications soliciting households to
complete online questionnaires or to be interviewed by telephone, sending
reminders and follow-ups in case of non-response.

Even National Statistical Offices that have started using electronic data
collection approaches, such as computer-assessed personal interviews \(CAPI\),
still rely heavily on personal interviews, some of the challenges in moving away
from face-to-face interviews to remote interviews and self-reporting
methodologies include:

- Implement new mechanisms to identify, contact, authenticate and communicate
  with respondents
- Establish mechanisms to geo-locate responses obtained via remote interviewing
  and self-reporting.
- Procure/develop and test IT systems to support computer-assisted telephone
  interviews and online self-reporting portals
- Implement mechanisms to support respondents in completing online
  questionnaires
- Implement mechanisms to support and oversee telephone-based interview
  workflows
- Ensure secure remote access to IT systems and secure data exchange.

National Statistical Offices that have already in place data collection
programmes based on computer-assisted personal interviews \(CAPI\) may consider
re-purposing this existing software and hardware infrastructure to support
computer-assisted telephone interviews \(CATI\) instead. This would allow to
leverage the existing devices \(tablets, personal digital assistants, smart
phones or portable computers\) as well as their specialized software, including
their ability to instantly transmit data over mobile data networks. However,
this re-purposing is not trivial. For instance, it requires to integrate CATI
operations with existing digital mapping and operational management applications
built under the assumption that enumerators/interviewers would be entering the
data on the same location as the respondent. As interviewers will now be
entering the information from a remote location, this creates new challenges for
the automatic geo-coding of questionnaire responses and for the supervision of
the interview process.
