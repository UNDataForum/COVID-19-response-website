description:
  Under the current COVID-19 situation and following the directives set by the
  government of Colombia, the National Statistical Office (DANE) has sought to
  adopt strategies that ensure the adequate performance of the institution.
  These strategies have been agreed under the framework of an internal Ad-hoc
  Emergency Committee that has allowed DANE to quickly adapt to the evolving
  situation. The adopted measures have been guided by the principle of ensuring
  the well-being of our staff (with more than 95 percent of DANE’s work force
  currently telecommuting and all administrative processes having been adjusted
  to be done virtually), while maximizing statistical production.

Under the current COVID-19 situation and following the directives set by the
government of Colombia, the
[National Statistical Office (DANE)](https://www.dane.gov.co/) has sought to
adopt strategies that ensure the adequate performance of the institution. These
strategies have been agreed under the framework of an internal Ad-hoc Emergency
Committee that has allowed DANE to quickly adapt to the evolving situation. The
adopted measures have been guided by the principle of ensuring the well-being of
our staff (with more than 95 percent of DANE’s work force currently
telecommuting and all administrative processes having been adjusted to be done
virtually), while maximizing statistical production.

Examples of these strategies include: continuity and reinforcement of monitoring
of self-completion of web surveys: minimization of in-person collection
operations; and the adoption of additional health security protocols according
to the guidelines established by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection.
In addition, DANE has strengthened data collection mechanisms for specific
statistical programmes (e.g., expanding the sample and identifying new sources
of information for the production of price statistics), and introduced the use
of telephone-based operations as substitute for face-to-face interviews. Data on
the housing deficit and the National Population and Housing Census geospatial
views application ("Geovisor") were also published ahead of time.

In addition to the aforementioned strategies that guarantee the regular
statistical production and in accordance to the new information demands, DANE
has launched the following initiatives in the context of the health emergency:

- Daily monitoring of prices and supply in wholesale markets, with daily special
  additional publications.
- Daily monitoring and weekly publication of the
  [prices of 26 products identified as essential](https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/en/estadisticas-por-tema/precios-y-costos/precios-de-venta-al-publico-de-articulos-de-primera-necesidad-pvpapn)
  by the national government.
- Releasing geospatial views at the block level of:

  - Vulnerability Index.
  - Multidimensional Poverty Index.
  - Population over 60 years.

The release of a
[vulnerability index at the level of blocks in the Geovisor application](https://geoportal.dane.gov.co/visor-vulnerabilidad/)
stands out, since this was a result of an inter-institutional approach, that
allowed to link information from the Institute for Health Technology Evaluation
(IETS), the National Statistical Office (DANE) and the National Planning
Department (DNP).

It is worth mentioning that DANE has released information to help national and
local government entities identify target populations for the distribution of
humanitarian aid and medical care, and to ensure that the national and local
programs reach households that were not initially included in other social
programs.
