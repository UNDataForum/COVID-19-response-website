_This article is also available in
[Russian](/statistics-canada-response-RU.pdf)._<br/><br/>In response to the
evolving COVID-19 situation, Statistics Canada has adopted a strategy that seeks
to ensure the continuity of Statistics Canada’s mission critical programs and
essential services. This note provides an overview of Statistics Canada's
response on such programmes and services, as well as other activites related to
monitoring, analysing and modeling the social and economic impacts of COVID-19
epidemic in Canada.

## Mission-critical programs

9. Quarterly Financial Survey
10. Tax data processing
11. Survey of Employment Payroll and Hours

19. Building permits
20. Investment in building construction
21. Financial flow and national balance sheet accounts

## Consumer Price Index

With respect to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Statistics Canada continues
collection. A significant amount of data comes from alternative sources and no
interruption is expected. For the February compilation, air fares were excluded
from the compilation of the CPI since people weren't able to take their flights.
Decision on how to treat goods that cannot be consumed still on-going - one
option would be to impute their movement with All-items CPI. Currently, no
change in expenditure weight is planned. Even though consumers are changing
their consumption behaviour, it is considered a temporary situation that doesn’t
justify changing the basket weights. For further information about how
Statistics Canada has addressed COVID-19 (to date) with respect to COVID-19

## Labour Force Survey

Labor Force Survey (LFS) collection continues and March collection (for February
reference month) marked the first ever completely remote LFS cycle. We deployed
the required laptops and cellphones to our interviewers to make this happen to
allow our interviewers to work from home. Our telephone interviewers (CATI) are
fully and securely connected now from their homes and continue their important
work as scheduled. Our in-person field interviewer operations (CAPI) have been
temporarily stopped in response to the public health directions, and employees
are now equipped to support telephone work where possible. Launch of the _Labour
Force Survey Disaster - Catastrophe Module_ (see also Social Impacts section
below) for the March reference month will add two questions designed to measure
the extent of hours lost (e.g., absences due to a person’s own illness,
self-isolation, caring for a sick family member) and gained (e.g. having to work
extra hours) during the entire month of March as a result of COVID-19. There are
also plans to eventually add questions on EI applications and telework.

## Building permits

In the context of the rapidly-evolving situation around the novel coronavirus,
Statistics Canada is releasing March 2020 preliminary flash estimates of
building permits for select regions. Data for this release is from open-source
building permit reports for 23 large municipalities, as well as municipal
building permit reports submitted to Statistics Canada by 2 April 2020.
Combined, these municipalities comprised approximately 29 percent of total
building permits by value in 2019. For further information on the release,
please
[follow this link](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200408/dq200408a-eng.htm).

## Industrial Product Price Index

April 8, 2020 Statistics Canada released flash estimates for the Industrial
Product Price Index (IPPI) for March 2020 using data received to date. While
this is not the full set of information on the IPPI (which will be released on
30 April 2020), these flash estimates provide an indication of economic
situation in Canada.
[Information on this can be found here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200408/dq200408e-eng.htm).

## Other Statistics Canada activities related to data and COVID19

Statistics Canada is undertaking several other innovative activities to respond
to the growing need to provide information on the economic and social impacts of
the COVID-19, and support the efforts of front-line agencies such as Public
Health Agency of Canada, the Department of National Defence, as well as first
responders in addressing this crisis.

For general information related to our activities please see:
[https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/covid19](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/covid19)

Statistics Canada has adopted has set up a multi-disciplinary team to address
various data needs and the work and this work has been organized along four
broad themes:

### 1. Economic impacts, analysis and modeling

Statistics will utilize its analysis and modelling capabilities to release as
much timely information as possible around the possible impacts of the virus in
a coherent and coordinated fashion, as the situation develops. As well, a
special Daily article will be published after each monthly release cycle that
integrates the key results across programs. This work will utilize Statistics
Canada’s modelling capacity to support the release of mission critical economic
indicators and/or to release broad advance economic indicators using nowcasting
techniques.

The first release of the interactive dashboard which examines the impact of
COVID-19 on the economy can be found
[here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/200326/dq200326b-eng.htm).

### 2. Special geospatial data requests and indicators, production and support

Statistics Canada is providing its considerable geo-spatial expertise to respond
to pressing information requests for geo-enabled data coming from various
federal partners and first responders monitoring and intervening directly in the
field during the COVID-19 crisis. This work will facilitate access to geo coding
and mapping of relevant socioeconomic information. This work involves working
with Natural Resources Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and Public
Safety Canada, to build dashboards and portals for PHAC to help them disseminate
socio-economic and health data, and information from their epidemiologists to
other federal departments, and health agencies at the provincial, territorial,
and local levels.

One example of Statistics Canada’s support to our public health agency and the
public can be found

and

### 3. Social impacts and new social data development related to COVID-19

Statistics Canada will monitor all work that could provide additional useful and
timely information for the management of the COVID-19 crisis. In the immediate
term, this Statistics Canada will remain "on-call" to respond to urgent requests
for support from PHAC (or other Federal Departments) and other COVID-related
Statistics Canada efforts. Over the mid- and long-term, the Agency will identify
and monitor key indicators of the social impacts of COVID-19. This work includes
launching of the Disaster-Catastrophe module in the LFS as well as associated
data development initiatives (e.g., panel surveys, rapid stats, etc.) for
retrospectively assessing the crisis.

- **Web panel survey on the impacts of COVID-19**

  Statistics Canada launched a web panel survey from 29 March to 3 April 2020
  and covered topics on the impacts of COVID19 on Canadians with a reference
  period that covered 22--28 March 2020. Participants consisted of a web panel
  of Canadians living in all 10 provinces. Follow
  [this link](https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3Instr.pl?Function=assembleInstr&lang=en&Item_Id=1280238)
  to further information on the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS). The
  first release from the web panel survey was on April 8 and can be found
  [here](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2020029-eng.htm).
  Other iterations of this survey will take place as necessary.

  <br/>

- **Crowdsourcing the impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians**

  Statistics Canada is using crowdsourcing to get an understanding about the
  impact of COVID-19 on Canadians. Questions include actions Canadian are taking
  to reduce the spread as well as impacts on their labour market activities.
  Information about this initiative can be found
  [here](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/survey/household/5311-COVID-19).

### 4. Modelling and surveillance support

Statistics Canada will respond to pressing information requests mostly coming
from Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) by providing expertise and
consultative services in the area of modeling and microsimulation to support
PHAC work in the area of projections. PHAC has already been engaged on this
front and are considering options. Numerous projects utilizing Statistics Canada
microsimulation capacity and its data science expertise are under consideration.
