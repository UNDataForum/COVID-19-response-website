  men

In order to measure and monitor differences in Covid-19 incidence and fatality
rates between women and men, data disaggregated, as a minimum, **by sex, age
groups and geographical areas** are urgently needed. Collecting and
disseminating additional data on employment-or lack of occupation-to capture the
most vulnerable workers, household type (one person, couples without children,
couples with children, lone parents, extended family), and access to social
protection and to mobile and virtual (health, education and financial) services
during physical distancing and/or isolation is also strongly recommended.

These data are important to understand the different burden and impact of
Covid-19 on women and men and to properly address shortcomings and specific
vulnerabilities and risks, including to mental health disorders and domestic
violence. To that end, while adhering to the principles of data confidentiality
and protection, it is **important that countries and international agencies
consistently disaggregate the information they collect, analyse and disseminate
on Covid-19 by sex, age and location**.
