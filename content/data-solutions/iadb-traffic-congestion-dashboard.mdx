part of its
[response to the COVID-19 crisis](https://www.iadb.org/en/coronavirus), the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) has launched a
[Coronavirus Impact Dashboard](https://www.iadb.org/en/topics-effectiveness-improving-lives/coronavirus-impact-dashboard)
to track the real-time impact of the coronavirus on countries in the region. The
dashboard tracks a range of variables in order to provide Latin American and
Caribbean policymakers, epidemiologists, and the general public with measures of
the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on peopleâ€™s behavior and economic
activity.

The first release of the dashboard includes daily data on infection cases and
deaths as well as proxies for social distancing such as changes in the intensity
of traffic congestion and the use of public transportation. As the crisis
evolves, IADB will be continuously updating the data and adding variables to
help understand and combat the impact of the coronavirus in the region.

IADB has made available the
[source data and code](https://github.com/EL-BID/IDB-IDB-Invest-Coronavirus-Impact-Dashboard)
of this dashboard on a publit Git repository, including a
[detailed methodological note](http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=EZSHARE-1350314980-529).
