INS Romania has carried out, besides the its normal statistical programme,
ad-hoc researches, in order to measure
[the impact of the health crisis on the economy](https://insse.ro/cms/en/covid-19-impactul-economic).

The first, carried out in the first days after the outbreak of the pandemic,
aimed at assessing the impact of the health crisis on the economy starting from
applying a questionnaire to the statisticians of the Territorial Statistics
Directorates. Over 800 respondents gave a first picture on the size of the
economic catastrophe that was about to occur in March and which is expected to
continue in April.

The second ad-hoc research aimed at evaluating the size of the activity volume
reduction in the economy and the reduction of employees number. Qualitative data
collected from a representative sample (over 8000 companies) were used, at
national level, but also by activity sectors, but also other quantitative
statistical data. It was estimated a reduction in the volume of activity in the
economy compared to a month with normal activity with 30% in March and 40% in
April, respectively.

The third research led to the estimation regarding the reduction size of the
foreign trade activity by categories of companies grouped according to their
size, the number of employees, the form of property, etc. The research was
carried out on a representative sample of more than 1700 companies covering at
national level about 70% of the foreign trade activity of the last month.
