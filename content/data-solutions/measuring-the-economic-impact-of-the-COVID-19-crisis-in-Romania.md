Responding to the need for statistical benchmarks for substantiating the public
and private decisions that will be taken in the coming months in response to the
COVID-19 crisis, the
[Institute of National Statistics (INS) of Romania](https://insse.ro/cms/en) is
making available to the public the results of
[ad-hoc research projects](https://insse.ro/cms/en/covid-19-impactul-economic),
aimed to measure the impact of the health crisis on different sectors of
economic activity.

The first, carried out in the first days after the outbreak of the pandemic, was
aimed at assessing the impact of the health crisis on the economy, applying a
questionnaire to the statisticians of the Territorial Statistics Directorates.
Over 800 respondents gave a first picture on the size of the economic
catastrophe that was about to occur in March and which is expected to continue
in April.

The
[second ad-hoc research](https://insse.ro/cms/en/content/experimental-research-assessment-covid-19-impact-economic-environment-march-and-april-2020-0)
aimed at evaluating the size of the activity volume reduction in the economy and
the reduction of employees number. This study used qualitative data collected
from a representative sample (over 8000 companies) at national level, by
activity sectors, as well as other quantitative statistical data. It allowed to
estimate that a reduction in the volume of activity in the economy of 30 percent
in March and 40 percent in April, compared to a month with normal activity.

A
[third research project](https://insse.ro/cms/en/content/survey-impact-sars-cov2-volume-exports-and-imports-goods-march-2020-0)
led to estimate the magnitude of the reduction in foreign trade activity by
different categories of companies (according to their size, number of employees,
form of property, etc.). This research relied on a representative sample of more
than 1700 companies, covering at national level about 70 percent of the foreign
trade activity of the previous month.
