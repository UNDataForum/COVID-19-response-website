description:
  In order to measure and monitor differences in COVID-19 incidence and fatality
  rates between women and men, data disaggregated, as a minimum, by sex, age
  groups and geographical areas are urgently needed. It is also highly
  recommended to ollect and disseminate additional data on employment,
  occupation (to capture the most vulnerable workers), household type (e.g., one
  person, couples without children, couples with children, lone parents,
  extended family), and access to social protection and to mobile and virtual
  services (e.g., health, education and financial) during physical distancing
  and/or isolation.

In order to measure and monitor differences in COVID-19 incidence and fatality
rates between women and men, data disaggregated, as a minimum, by sex, age
groups and geographical areas are urgently needed. It is also highly recommended
to ollect and disseminate additional data on employment, occupation (to capture
the most vulnerable workers), household type (e.g., one person, couples without
children, couples with children, lone parents, extended family), and access to
social protection and to mobile and virtual services (e.g., health, education
and financial) during physical distancing and/or isolation.

These data are important to understand the different burden and impact of
COVID-19 on women and men and to properly address shortcomings and specific
vulnerabilities and risks, including to mental health disorders and domestic
violence. To that end, while adhering to the principles of data confidentiality
and protection, it is important that countries and international agencies
consistently disaggregate the information they collect, analyse and disseminate
on COVID-19 by sex, age and location.
