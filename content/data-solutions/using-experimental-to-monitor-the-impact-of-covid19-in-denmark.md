The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created a huge demand for fast data to measure
its impact on society. [Statistics Denmark](https://www.dst.dk/en), in
collaboration with other members of the national statistical system, has been
using new data sources and methods to provide faster indicators of development.
These Experimental Statistics, whose methodologies are subject to continuous
development and are not part of the official statistics production, can
nevertheless be of great value when users demand fast, innovative and reliable
measures of development. In the context of the COVID-19 situation, they provide
valuable information to understand the pandemic’s impact on consumption,
industry, employment, transportation, trade, etc. Experimental statistics also
serves as supplement to mainstream statistical methods where, due to the
COVID-19 situation, the data is uncertain or lacking.

## COVID-19 Experimental Statistics

### Deaths per day

Statistics Denmark publishes deaths-per-day in their
[StatBank](https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1280). These
are updated every Friday and include all deaths recorded up to and including the
previous weekend. Due to the very short interval between the day of occurrence
and the date of publication, the figures should be considered provisional and
may have minor deviation with quarterly statement of number of deaths. The chart
below compares the 10-day moving average of the number of deaths per calendar
day in 2020 with the corresponding 2015-19 average. Starting in April 2020, the
effect of the COVID-19 pandemic appears clearly in the data.

### Covid-19 tests, infections, hospitalization, survival and deaths

Statistics on COVID-19 infections, hospitalization, number of patients in
intensive care and on ventilator support, as well as survival and deaths, are
compiled based on information from Staten
[Serum Institute’s](https://en.ssi.dk/) monitoring reports. The figures are
updated by Statistics Denmark daily on weekdays. Deaths recorded within 30 days
of COVID-19 infection are included regardless of whether COVID-19 is the root
cause or not. Administrative data from Cause of Death register are used and the
figures may be updated as information on deaths become complete. Statistics on
the number of infections by age group and geographic location are also
available.

## Impact of Covid-19 on the economy

### Economic sectors

Preliminary figures from the Business Tendency Survey conducted in April 2020
show that the Service and Retail sectors were the worst hit by the pandemic (see
the [full report](https://www.dst.dk/ext/formid/erhverv-covid19--pdf)). The
Business Confidence Indicator also shows a plunge from 96.0 in March to 50.5 in
April 2020, a sharper decline than during the financial crisis of 2008. The
indicator is a composite index based on data on fours economic sectors, namely
industry, constructions, services, and retail. However, industry seems to be not
affected by the pandemic as of March which recorded an increase of 10% in
revenue from the previous month (see
[the full report](https://www.dst.dk/ext/formid/industriens-omsaetning-covid19--pdf)).

### Consumption

Credit card and mobile phone payments in Danish and foreign stores are used to
produce faster measures of private consumption. Further information on the
effect of COVID-19 on consumption are available from
[this website](https://research.danskebank.com/research/#/Research/articlepreview/45e07f2f-8707-4358-a09a-5eb9b79ee03f/EN).
The figures are updated weekly.

### Employment

Daily statistics on unemployment are compiled based on the number of cash
benefit and unemployment benefit recipients, and the total number of unemployed
and newly registered unemployed persons. Statistics on the number of total
vacancies and new vacancies are also produced as an indicator of the demand side
of employment. The information is collected by the Danish Agency for Labour
Market and Recruitment.
[Recently published figures](https://jobindsats.dk/jobindsats/publikationer.aspx)
show a strong negative effect of COVID-19 on employment.

### Transport

From a daily count of vehicles passing through 30 measurement points across the
country, transport statistics is compiled which contain figures on total road
traffic, passenger cars and vans traffic, and truck traffic. Recent figures show
a sharp decline since March 2020. More information is available from the
[Danish Road Directorate](http://www.vejdirektoratet.dk/side/trafikkens-udvikling-i-tal)
website.

### Aviation

Daily statistics on number of commercial flights from Copenhagen Airport are
compiled in collaboration with
[Danmarks Nationalbank](https://www.nationalbanken.dk/en), based on data from
the [OpenSky Network](http://www.opensky-network.org/). Recent figures show a
sharp decline starting in mid-March which almost reached baseline by the end of
the month.

### Maritime

Using AIS data available from the Danish Maritime Authority, a ship index is
compiled to measure the number of cargo and container ships that have entered
Denmark’s ports. Daily figures are available which are updated weekly. More
information is available from
[this website](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/emner/geografi-miljoe-og-energi/infrastruktur/havne).

### International trade (non-EU)

To measure the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on external trade, information from
the Customs is used to compile daily indicator of exports to non-EU countries.
The figures show that exports remained above 2019 levels. Imports, however, fell
in late March but rebounded to 2019 levels in Easter. For more details, see this
[working paper](https://www.dst.dk/ext/formid/varehandel-udenfor-EU-covid19--pdf)
and the
[source data](<https://www.dst.dk/ext/8169583819/0/formid/Data-Indikator-for-varehandlen-med-lande-uden-for-EU-(xlsx)--xlsx>).

### Modeling the COVID-19 effects on the economy

Statistics Denmark's model group has developed a module for their economic model
(ADAM) to estimate the macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
module allows users to input their assumptions about the length and severity of
the pandemic to estimate the impact on the economy accordingly. Relief and
crisis packages are considered in the model. More information is available from
the [ADAM](https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/ADAM) website.
