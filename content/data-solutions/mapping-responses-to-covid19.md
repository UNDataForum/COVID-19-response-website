  data revolution'
date: 2020-06-22
---

In national statistic offices (NSOs) of countries around the world, geospatial
data is needed for a swift response to the COVID-19 emergency. Initiatives aimed
at integrating geospatial data with statistics help decision making, both in the
short term and towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The post provides an overview of geo-statistical initiatives undertaken by NSOs
in response to coronavirus, offering valuable lessons to strengthen innovative
partnerships between NSOs and other stakeholders in the context of the COVID-19
crisis. Real progress in the data revolution for Sustainable Development
motivate NSOs to further improve their performance towards the 2030 Agenda
leading innovative data partnerships.

## Introduction

Antonio Gramsci said at the beginning of last century that "the old world is
dying but the new one is delayed in emerging and, in that, chiaroscuro monsters
emerge". If this thinker had lived in our days, he would have recognized one of
those monsters in the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. And not only because of
the death that the virus leaves behind in its wake, but also because of the gaps
it reveals in the responses of governments.

As a global phenomenon that has evolved over time and space with unprecedented
operational conditions, many governments have been hampered in their ability to
generate, share, match and disseminate geospatial and statistical data in a
timely and reliable manner. However, there are few but valuable geospatial
response initiatives to COVID-19 at the global, continental and national levels.
At the global level, the well-known COVID-19 monitoring initiative launched by
Johns Hopkins University combines multiple sources of real-time statistical and
geographical data to track the pandemic in 188 countries.

## Data partnerships and NSO geospatial responses to COVID-19

To help understanding the pandemic impact across space, various of NSOs have
launched geo-statistical solutions. Some examples are described in the following
table

| Leading NSO       | Type of Analysis / Visualisation | Kind of Partnership | Source Data Layer      | Data reusability |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |

_The type of partnership is based on classification established in Citizen to
government data partnerships: What can we learn from and recommend to civil
society groups working in the official statistics domain? In source data layer
"+" means that there are other layers used. In Kind of Partnership "+" means
other partners._

- The European Union Statistics Office (Eurostat) makes available geo-referenced
  data on hospitals and other health care facilities through the web services of
  its ESTAT-GISCO project, which in combination with data on roads allows to
  analyze access to health services by the population in different areas.
- Statistics Norway and the National Institute of Statistics of Portugal
  produced open data sets mapping the sub-national distribution of coronavirus
  infections.
- The National Statistical Institue of Spain initiated, in collaboration with
  the three major mobile telephone operators in the country (Orange, Telefónica
  and Vodafone) a study of the location of more than 80 percent of mobile phones
  to understand the mobility of people during the COVID-19 crisis across the
  territory.
- Ireland, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) has partnered with the national
  mapping agency (Ordnance Survey Ireland), the Department of Housing, Planning
  and Local Government, and the All Islands Research Observatory at the
  University of Maynooth, to develop, with the support of Esri Ireland, a
  COVID-19 National Data Hub on its GeoHive platford.
- The Ghanaian Statistical Service (GSS), with the support of Flowminder, used
  anonymized and aggregated real-time data from the mobile network operator
  Vodafone to understand mobility patterns of the population on an
  "origin-destination matrix".
- The National Statistical Office of Colombia (DANE) developed an interactive
  application to identify, at the municipal, the geographic distribution of
  population groups that are more susceptible to infection by COVID-19. It is
  based on estimates obtained by linking morbidity data with demographic
  characteristics of territorial units from the last census and from
  administrative records.
- The National Statistical Office of Mexico (INEGI) has set up a COVID-19
  geospatial open data platform allowing overlay infection on cases at the state
  level with information on health facilities and basic commercial activities
  and supply points of interest.
- Statistics Sweden's mapping tool allows user to explore data on the location
  of the vulnerable populations and other statistics at the national,
  municipality and more detailed geographic disaggregation levels.

## An unfinished revolution in data

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development calls on a wide range of actors--not
just governments and their national statistical systems--to work together to
generate timely and usable data, while facilitating informed decision-making,
including that during emergencies. And the purposeful and synergetic
associations of partners illustrated above are a step forward towards delivering
on the promise of a “data revolution for sustainable development”.

As the governments of most countries in the world take action to contain and
mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, National Statistical Offices are
called to lead the response to increased demands from users for more timely,
reliable and accessible data to monitor the pandemic and each of the 17 SDGs.
However, as noted by the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st
Century (PARIS21), the COVID-19 crisis has caused a double disruption that
"squeezes" national statistical offices between increased demand-side pressures
from data users, on one hand, and supply-side pressures derived from operational
and technical resource constraints, on the other. In many cases, this double
disruption has resulted in interruptions in the value chain of official data and
statistics in the short and medium terms, and the inability to plan for and
sustain statistical production in the long term.

The leadership role around the world that NSOs are called to assume in realizing
the data revolution for sustainable development is still work in progress. This
is reflected in the mixed responses of national data systems to the COVID-19
pandemic, where many of the initiatives best known to the general public are
being led by actors outside the official global statistical community.

Leadership and resilience, especially in the face of external and emerging
phenomena, still remain a challenge for a significant number of NSOs.
Reinforcing leadership and resilience of NSOs could not only help in the
understanding of global--and predominantly territorial--phenomena such as
pandemics but would also underpin an overarching vision of the effective
contribution of collaboration with third party sources. And at its core, the
effective leadership of NSOs will require inclusiveness. Seven preliminary
lessons from the revised data associations

While a variety of initiatives have been identified from the global, regional
and national/subnational levels, there is still ample opportunity to reflect
impacts and issues by integrating diverse sources represented through geospatial
dimensions. Such innovation could effectively help in the understanding of the
territorial behaviour of the pandemic "monster". Insisting on a successful
strategy in this regard will facilitate decision making resulting from the
territorial processes involved in the pandemic, especially those that support
the return to the new normality.

1. There is still lack of real-time geospatial responses revealing challenges
   related to the coronavirus, including individualized location of infected
   persons or follow-up of contacts maintained by those affected.

2. Data integration challenges still prevent the transformation of existing data
   systems. So far, data integration has been limited to transitory experiments
   and data laboratories to create dashboards and visualizations that overlay
   different data sources.

3. Many of the current geospatial response laboratories have demonstrated in a
   very short time the great potential for integrating sources from different
   origins, suggesting that the necessary institutional arrangements can be
   solved also in the short term, especially when the necessary incentives are
   ensured.

4. The response to the COVID-19 crisis has helped consolidate
   Government2Business data partnerships between private actors and NSOs.
   Although many of these initiatives are already available at an experimental
   level, it is still not a common experience for NSOs to enter into data
   partnerships with business partners, especially not in developing countries.

5. Commendable efforts have been made by statistical offices, in particular in
   less developed countries, to disaggregate national data using administrative
   records or surveys from other official sectors of government. Such
   innovations demonstrate that in the context of emergency it is possible to
   move forward expeditiously in harnessing the data revolution for sustainable
   development.

6. There is need for a clear and carefully targeted communication campaign to
   avoid generating further confusion among the population. In the case of the
   vulnerability viewer led by DANE in Colombia, for example, a social media
   campaign focused on clarifying that the initiative did not present real time
   data, but an analysis of pre-existing data before the pandemic. Also, in the
   case of INE in Spain, further assurances of proper use of private data were
   needed.

7. There is a critical need for collaboration between civil society and NSOs to
   provide geospatial responses to COVID-19. This kind of data partnerships are
   especially recommended in the 2030 Agenda and are being actively studied for
   successful data partnerships. Considering the broad granularity of
   territorial problems, the inclusion of partners from the geospatial community
   in future NSO initiatives should be promoted, not only by calling on other
   official or private actors, but also academia and the civic sector, both
   users and producers of data.

The unprecedented collaboration between NSOs and sources from different origins
provided by external actors is the most common denominator identified in the
above observations. This anticipates real progress in the data revolution and
motivates NSOs to further explore data partnerships with third parties to meet
any future needs. A likely rationale for success is that these partnerships
represent a Pareto Optimum exchange in the sense that they achieve an increase
in the well-being of all by making better data available for decision making
without decreasing the well-being of the partners providing these data.
According to the reviewed research reports, the data partnerships have not
implied major sacrifices or additional costs for any of the parties in their
response to the coronavirus.

Taking this logic a step further, NSO leadership could be strengthened through
the generalization of pioneering data partnerships. The geostatistical domain
should capitalize on these costly lessons from the pandemic. Highly conceived
strategies could provide the momentum needed to accelerate the delayed
monitoring that will guide the achievement of the sustainable development goals
called for in the 2030 Agenda with a healthy emphasis on effective visualization
and geographic disaggregation.
