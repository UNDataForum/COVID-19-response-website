Responding to the need for statistical benchmarks for substantiating the public
and private decisions that will be taken in the coming months in response to the
COVID-19 crisis, the
[Institute of National Statistics (INS) of Romania](https://insse.ro/cms/en) is
making available a series of
[ad-hoc studies measuring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Romanian economy](https://insse.ro/cms/en/covid-19-impactul-economic),
including rapid estimates for the decreases in economic activity, employment,
and exports.

A first study, carried out during the first days of the pandemic outbreak in
March, assessed the impact of COVID-19 on the economy using an ad-hoc survey by
the regional statistics directorates. Over 800 respondents gave a first picture
of the magnitude of the economic disaster that was expected to occur in March
and likely to continue in April.

A
[second ad-hoc study](https://insse.ro/cms/en/content/experimental-research-assessment-covid-19-impact-economic-environment-march-and-april-2020-0)
aimed to evaluate the reduction of the economic activity as well as the negative
impact on employment. Qualitative and quantitative data collected from a
representative, nationwide sample of over 8000 companies was used to assess the
overall impact and the impact by economic sectors. It was estimated that the
volume of activity in the economy would decrease by 30 percent in March and by
40% in April compared to months with normal activity.

A
[third study](https://insse.ro/cms/en/content/survey-impact-sars-cov2-volume-exports-and-imports-goods-march-2020-0)
estimated the reduction of foreign trade activity by enterprise characteristics
including size, number of employees, legal form, etc. The study was carried out
using a representative sample of more than 1700 companies and with a combined
coverage of 70 percent of the regular foreign trade activity. A third of the
responding companies estimated that their export volume will decrease by up to
quarter of the normal volume, another 12 percent of the companies expected a
drop by up to half their normal exports, and 7 percent of the companies expected
an even higher impact.
