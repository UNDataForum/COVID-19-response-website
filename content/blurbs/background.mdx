The global COVID-19 crisis is affecting critical operations across the entire
global statistical system. National and international statistical organizations
need to take immediate action to ensure the continuity of key statistical
compilation activities and the continued availability of data to inform
emergency mitigation actions by governments and all sectors of society.

Senior management in statistical organizations are working together with their
own front-line managers and IT teams, and with partners at the national and
global levels, to deal with the current emergency. This includes:

- Establishing new procedures and workflows, collaborating in virtual teams, and
  implementing secure remote data access and data exchange capabilities for
  staff members of National Statistical Offices, providers of data inputs and
  the users of statistical outputs to remain effectively linked together
  throughout the statistical value chain.
- Adapting and innovating data production methods and processes to ensure
  continuity of major official statistical programmes
- Addressing the increased need for data openness and accessibility to meet the
  urgent demand for reliable and accurate information on the spreading and
  impact of the virus as well as its impact on people's lives and all sectors of
  the economy.

Stakeholders from across the global statistical community are ready to support
National Statistical Offices to address multiple challenges of the current
crisis. As part of this effort, the
[United Nations Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/home/) is leading a
collaborative effort with the
[Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data](http://www.data4sdgs.org/)
and [Open Data Watch](https://opendatawatch.com/), to develop this website to
share guidance, best practices, information resources and tools to help
statistical organizations function during an emergency situation in which most
of their staff is suddenly unable to work on-site.
