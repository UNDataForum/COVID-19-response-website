  Division, in collaboration with the Global Partnership for Sustainable
  Development Data and Open Data Watch, as well as statistical offices from
  across the UN System, has created a dedicated email address where National

  inquiries and share experiences and lessons learnt related to the response of
  national and global statistical systems. Please submit your inquiries to
  <covid-19.stats@un.org>.

  dedicated to the sharing of experiences among statistical experts from across
  the world working to support national statistical systems in their response to

  easy-to-use medium for the staff of National Statistical Offices to share

  the extraordinary challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global
  Partnership for Sustainable Development Data has established an English,
