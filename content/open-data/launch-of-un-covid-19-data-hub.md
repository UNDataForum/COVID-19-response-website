governments across the globe and the global development community are responding
to the COVID-19 pandemic with unprecedented measures. Though capacities in
fighting the outbreak across nations vary significantly, all countries need to
rely heavily on the availability of geographically disaggregated data in key
thematic areas and for various groups of the population. As an immediate first
step in addressing these data needs, the Statistics Division of the United
Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs has identified four thematic
areas, namely: (1) virus tracking, (2) population, (3) health infrastructure and
(4) economy. These data sets will help in mapping the spread of the disease,
understanding trends, identifying vulnerable population groups, as well as
measuring the economic impact of the pandemic. Ultimately, the aim is to provide
access to trustworthy information and to help communicate clear messages so
decision makers can address the outbreak effectively and efficiently.

The new [COVID-19 Data Hub](https://covid-19-data.unstatshub.org/) is the result
of a partnership effort between the
[Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/home/) of the
[UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/)
and [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home), with the following key objectives:

- To provide countries access to software and tools that will enable them to be
  part of a federated network of COVID-19 data hubs.
- To empower countries through the use of web GIS technologies for sharing
  available data resources and web services in an open and interoperable
  environment, linking to a federated network of national and global COVID-19
  data hubs.
- To help national statistical offices get quickly up to speed in building their
  own COVID-19 open data sites, with ready-to-use templates that allow them to
  focus on responding to the urgent demand for data and insights from their
  constituencies.

Our technology partner Esri has announced a
[COVID-19 Response Package](https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/announcements/esri-to-provide-mapping-resources-to-who-member-states/)
for Ministries of Health and
[Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)](https://www.who.int/ihr/alert_and_response/outbreak-network/en/)
partners that will be now made available to National Statistical Offices for
using Esriâ€™s geospatial platform and tools.

The Covid-19 Data Hub is part of a larger effort carried by the UN Statistics
Division in collaboration with the
[Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD)](http://www.data4sdgs.org/)
and [Open Data Watch (ODW)](https://opendatawatch.com/), that launched a
[COVID-19 response website](https://covid-19-response.unstatshub.org/) to
provide guidance and tools and share best practices to ensure the operational
continuity of data programmes by National Statistical Offices, and to address
issues of open and timely access to critical data to respond to the global
COVID-19 crisis.
