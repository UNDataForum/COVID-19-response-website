Identifying existing datasets for priority dissemination is the first step to
leveraging open data for action during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather than focus
on collecting new data, national statistical offices should locate existing
useful data from traditional and non-traditional sources and publish them while
adhering to open data standards to maximize access and usability. This section
identifies resources to understand the state of open statistical data in a
country, examples of data published by others that are critical to understanding
COVID-19, and initiatives underway that use data to stop the pandemic.

## Tools to understand the state of open data in your country

- [Open Data Inventory](https://odin.opendatawatch.com/) (Open Data Watch): A
  tool for NSOs to discover how complete and open their statistical offerings
  are. The Open Data Inventory also identifies key datasets and disaggregations
  for countries to prioritize.
- [Open Data Barometer](https://opendatabarometer.org/?_year=2017&indicator=ODB)
  (World Wide Web Foundation): An index focused on the readiness,
  implementation, and impact of open government data that includes, but is not
  limited to, national statistics.

## Guidance to support NSOs in opening their data

- [Guidance on the implementation of open data in national statistical offices ](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/51st-session/documents/BG-Item3v-Guidance_OD-E.pdf)
  (UN Working Group on Open Data): This paper addresses key open data topics of
  particular relevance to NSOs and provides country examples.
- [Open Data Section of National Strategies for the Development of Statistics Guidelines](https://nsdsguidelines.paris21.org/node/530)
  (PARIS21): This chapter of the NSDS Guidelines covers concepts and definitions
  of openness and how these are increasingly used to promote accountability and
  transparency of government with a focus on statistical systems, agencies, and
  their operations.

## Examples of useful COVID-19 open data

### Global

- The **World Health Organization (WHO)** publishes in their
  [daily situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/)
  the global and national tally of COVID-19 cases and deaths..
- The **Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins
  University** has a
  [dashboard and data for download site](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)
  of global cases, including presumptive cases.
- The **European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)** provides a
  [daily data](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)
  on the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide in downloadable
  form, as well as a
  [situation dashboard](https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html)
  with latest surveillance data with case tallies, deaths, and maps of the
  spread of the virus.

### Regional

- The **OECD Secretariat** is calling for evidence on the release and use of
  Open Government Data (OGD) in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The
  [live and open repository](http://www.oecd.org/gov/digital-government/use-of-open-government-data-to-address-covid19-outbreak.htm)
  will reflect the different uses of data as we move through the COVID-19
  outbreak.

### National

- **Australia Bureau of Statistics** created a page where they publish all their
  [data products dedicated to measure the impact of COVID-19](https://www.abs.gov.au/covid19).
- **Statistics Canada** publishes a
  [dashboard presenting selected data relevant for monitoring the impacts of COVID-19](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020009-eng.htm)
  on economic activity in Canada.
- The **National Health Commission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China** publish
  daily updates on
  [key COVID-19 indicators](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020009-eng.htm).
- Every day at noon, the **US Center for Disease Control** publishes detailed
  [data on COVID-19 cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html)
