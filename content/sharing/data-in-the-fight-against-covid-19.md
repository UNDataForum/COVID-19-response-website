The current global COVID-19 crisis has created an unprecedented need for timely
data, disaggregated by age, sex, location and other markers, in order to inform
policies and planning aimed to minimize the risk for the population, especially
the most vulnerable groups. This
[UN World Data Forum](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/undataforum/index.html)
webinar will explore the extent to which the statistical community is ready for
such a huge challenge, and will provide an opportunity to learn from recent
experiences of governments working together with partners at the national and
global levels in adopting innovative approaches for the collection of critical
data, such as daily COVID-19 case information disaggregated by various markers.
The webinar will also discuss how data collected by National Statistics Offices
are being used to forecast gaps in the required health service resources, such
as hospital beds, and how this data is being translated into actionable,
ready-to-use information and insights to respond effectively to the crisis.

This webinar will:

- Bring experiences from 3 entities working at the forefront of this crisis to
  provide data support.
- Highlight the challenges and lessons learnt to improve the data collection and
  provide sufficient empirical data to respond to the pandemic.

The webinar is part of the
[United Nations World Data Forum webinar series](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/undataforum/webinar/index.html)
that aims to showcase some examples on how national and international
organizations are leveraging various techniques and methodologies to provide
up-to-date information to decision-makers to mitigate the global COVID-19
crisis.
