This [UN World Data Forum](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/undataforum/index.html)
webinar will explore how the statistical community is responding to the
challenge of providing timely data, disaggregated by age, sex, location and
other markers, in order to inform policies and planning aimed to minimize the
risks of the COVID-19 crisis for the population, especially the most vulnerable
groups.

Participants will learn from recent experiences of governments working together
with partners at the national and global levels in adopting innovative
approaches for the collection of critical data, such as daily COVID-19 case
information disaggregated by various markers. The webinar will also discuss how
data collected by National Statistics Offices are being used to forecast gaps in
the required health service resources, such as hospital beds, and how this data
is being translated into actionable insights to respond effectively to the
crisis.

This webinar will:

- Bring experiences from 3 entities working at the forefront of this crisis to
  provide data support.
- Highlight the challenges and lessons learnt to improve the data collection and
  provide sufficient empirical data to respond to the pandemic.

The webinar is part of the
[United Nations World Data Forum webinar series](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/undataforum/webinar/index.html)
that aims to showcase some examples on how national and international
organizations are leveraging various techniques and methodologies to provide
up-to-date information to decision-makers to mitigate the global COVID-19
crisis.
