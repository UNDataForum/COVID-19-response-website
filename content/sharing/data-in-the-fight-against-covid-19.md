Test

In the midst of the current global COVID-19 crisis, there is an unprecedented
need for data to not only enable decision makers to inform policies and planning
but to also minimize the risk for all especially the vulnerable population
groups. For this purpose, timely data disaggregated by age, sex, location and
other markers is important to inform decision makers and the general public.

From the point of view of the statistical community, are we ready for such a
huge challenge? What do we learn from this challenge and experiences?
Governments are working together with partners at the national and global level
to deal with the current emergency by adapting innovative production methods and
processes to ensure collection of critical data at various levels. Daily case
information is being collected to provide demographic information disaggregated
by various markers. Data collected by National Statistics Offices are also being
used to forecast gaps in the required health service resources, such as hospital
beds, to respond to the crisis effectively. Also critical is to translate data
into actionable, ready-to-use information and insights to benefit
decision-makers.

This webinar will:

- Bring experiences from 3 entities working at the forefront of this crisis to
  provide data support.
- Highlight the challenges and lessons learnt to improve the data collection and
  provide sufficient empirical data to respond to the pandemic.

The webinar is part of the
[United Nations World Data Forum webinar series](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/undataforum/webinar/index.html)
that aims to showcase some examples on how national and international
organizations are leveraging various techniques and methodologies to provide
up-to-date information to decision-makers to mitigate the global COVID-19
crisis.
