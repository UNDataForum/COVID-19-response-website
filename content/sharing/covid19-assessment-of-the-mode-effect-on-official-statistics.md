Since the health emergency arising from the global COVID-19 pandemic, national
statistical offices (NSOs) had to interrupt primary information collection
abruptly as part of many of their statistical operations, including household
surveys. Considering the rapid spread of the disease, governments had imposed
curfews, movement restrictions, and compulsory quarantines, among other health
measures.

These restrictions have eventually led to the suspension of face-to-face data
collection for household surveys. NSOs had to carry out surveys over the
telephone. This change in the collection methodology was necessary for the
continuity of employment and poverty figures.

During the pandemic, ECLAC had published a series of recommendations[^1] focused
on maintaining the best methodological and technical practices within NSO
processes. These documents were broadly disseminated and discussed through
several webinars with the support of the Transmission Knowledge Network of the
ECLAC Americas Statistical Conference. Among others, ECLAC recommendations for
returning to a “new normal” included to consider a transition period in which
telephone operations continue to be carried out, maintaining flexibility, and
noting that new confinements in some areas are possible; to adopt technical
procedures for eliminating coverage and selection biases, as regular processes
for household surveys inside NSO; to separate the effect of the collection mode
changes from the impact of the pandemic trying to maintain mixed-mode collection
schemes during a reasonable time in the post-pandemic period.

COVID-19 and its impact on household surveys are also covered by the
Intersecretariat Working Group on Household Surveys under the COVID-19 Task
Force, with the following objectives: (a) support the coordination of the
COVID-19 impact surveys in countries; (b) provide guidance to countries both on
maintaining the continuity of regular survey programmes and various
methodological aspects of COVID-19 related surveys; and (c) establish a
collective vision on the implications of COVID-19 for reshaping the national
household survey programmes[^2].

### Objectives and outcomes

As many countries have switched the survey mode from face-to-face to telephone
due to the pandemic and are now gradually resuming face-to-face interviewing
following the opening up of economies, this webinar aims to delve deeper into
assessing the impact of data collection mode on official statistics and the
current methodologies NSOs are using to distinguish the mode effect from the
pandemic effect. The webinar will also discuss how the experiences gained by
countries during the pandemic provide an opportunity for household surveys to
move towards a “new normal”; and the challenges associated with such transition.

### Target audience

The webinar will bring together statisticians from National Statistical Offices
(NSOs) and other parts of the National Statistical Systems (NSSs) to strengthen
their capacity on analysis of household surveys, with a focus on the assessment
of collection-mode effect due to the COVID19 pandemic.
