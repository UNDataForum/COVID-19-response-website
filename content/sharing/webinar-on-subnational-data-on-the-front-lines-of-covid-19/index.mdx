The first webinar in a
[new series of conferences](https://paris21.org/node/3363) organized by
[PARIS21](https://paris21.org) and the
[Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)](https://data.iadb.org/) will launch on
December 8, 2020 at 2:00 pm EST. The webinar, entitled "Subnational data on the
front lines of the battle against COVID-19," will explore different cases of
data generated by public and social sector actors on the front lines of
responding to the pandemic. The data generated from these efforts is the product
of the response to the pandemic and is representative of independent efforts.
**The webinar will be held in Spanish.**

The main objective of this session is to learn about specific efforts to produce
data on the impact of COVID at the subnational level. Another topic to be
discussed at this event will be how these efforts could be replicated in
national statistical systems and what their public utility. We will see how the
data generated on issues related to the pandemic at the subnational level are
very useful since they generate value or add it in the data chains.

This webinar will lay the foundation for understanding

- the response to the pandemic at the subnational level,
- how sub-national data is used and
- how they can be reused throughout the national statistical system to provide
  important cross-sectoral information.
