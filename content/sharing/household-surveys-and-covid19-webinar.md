While the pandemic has resulted in considerable data collection challenges,
surveys can also play a crucial role in understanding the social, economic and
health impacts of COVID-19. As part of the
[UNSD-DFID](https://unstats.un.org/capacity-development/UNSD-DFID/) project,
which is working with 20 countries in Africa and Asia to support their SDG
monitoring and COVID-19 data response, the
[UN Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org) hosted a
[webinar](https://unstats.un.org/capacity-development/meetings/UNSD-DFID-webinar-household-survey/)
covering topics including the role of surveys during the pandemic, telephone
surveys and sampling, and questionnaire design and data collection. It also
includes a presentation by Dr. Ola Awad, Director General of the Palestinian
Central Bureau of Statistics ([PCBS](http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/default.aspx)),
highlighting how they have been responding to COVID-19, including using surveys
to measure the impacts of the pandemic on people's lives. Here you can find the
video, a copy of the presentations, and a Q and A based on the questions raised
during the webinar.
