The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic is disrupting everyday life in
unprecedented ways. To address these data and capacity related challenges, the
PARIS21 partnership is hosting a
[webinar on 8 April, from 15:30-16:30 CET](https://paris21.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e3ad8097ecf1a36cabd12a3fb&id=aa6b2a006c&e=fbb871111b)
for National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and other organisations, in particular
from low- and middle-income countries, to share their experience and how they
plan to mitigate its effects in the near and long term.

NSOs in affected countries find themselves in a very challenging situation. Many
NSOs with limited IT capacities are forced to move into virtual work environment
and adjust to a new data demand from

1. Policymakers to understand and track the COVID-19 impact,
2. Citizens in search of reliable data sources.

Many NSOs struggle to conduct their usual statistical activities while
maintaining the safety of staff. At the same time, additional data demands
create additional pressure on the NSO to coordinate effectively with line
ministries (such as the ministry of finance or the ministries if health) to
produce ad-hoc data while continuing regular data collection, which will be
essential in the aftermath of the crisis.

To address these data and capacity related challenges, the PARIS21 partnership
is hosting a webinar, calling on NSOs and other organisations in the data for
development communities, in particular from low- and middle-income countries to
share their current experience amidst the global pandemic, and how they plan to
mitigate its effects in the near and long term.
