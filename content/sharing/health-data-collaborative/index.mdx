### Key messages:

1. **Partnerships are key to success:** The
   [Health Data Collaborative](https://www.healthdatacollaborative.org/) (HDC)
   is a collaborative platform that leverages and aligns partner technical and
   financial resources to strengthen country data systems for equitable service
   delivery and adapt global goods to local contexts;

1. **Build on the COVID-19 response to accelerate sustainable support to drive
   SDGs:** strong data systems are needed to control COVID-19; lessons learned
   and aligning partner support for country data and digital plans are crucial
   to accelerate action for the health-related SDGs;

1. **Strong Health Information Systems are needed to produce data for action:**
   Collection, storage, analysis, validation and use of health data is often
   fragmented and piecemeal. This increases reporting burdens â€“ especially for
   frontline health workers. Aligning efforts for Government M&E data plans
   increases efficiency, reduces reporting burdens and increases sharing during
   emergencies.

### Meeting Objectives:

1. **To promote data as a public good** for improving health outcomes,
   strengthening country capacities to use data for SDG targets and addressing
   the needs of communities left behind;

1. **To commit to stronger coordinating data health-related SDGs,** by aligning
   resources at all levels to improve data systems and digital tools to drive
   country-based evidence-based policy implementation and service delivery;

1. **To fill data gaps and better use of data through partnerships, such as HDC
   and SDG Global Action Plan (SDG GAP)** using a mix of tools (such as SCORE)
   and technical assistance to increase sharing, learning and engagement between
   partners and countries.
