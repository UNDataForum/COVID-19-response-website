Join the [UN Statistics Division](https://twitter.com/unstats?lang=en), the
[Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data](https://twitter.com/data4SDGs)
and [Open Data Watch](https://twitter.com/opendatawatch) for our second
[#CovidDataChat](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidDataChat) on Wednesday, 29
April at 12:00PM ET, directly after the UN World Data Forum webinar,
[Data in the Fight Against COVID-19](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/undataforum/webinar/index.html).
The Twitter chat will provide a great opportunity to continue the conversation
from the webinar and share your thoughts, experiences, and follow-up questions
with statistical experts around the world on the role of national statistical
systems in ensuring that reliable and timely data is available and ready to use
in informing the fight against #COVID-19.

- Make sure to include the chat hashtag **#CovidDataChat** at the beginning of
  each of your answers, so that you are part of the chat.

  LIMIT hashtags to a maximum of 3 per tweet.
