National Statistical Offices (NSOs) around the world have been affected from
disruptions of statistical operations caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic
has highly hampered the ability of national statistical systems to produce
crucial data, causing serious disruptions to censuses, household surveys, and
other crucial data collection, processing and dissemination operations. At the
same time, obtaining high-quality, timely and reliable data remains especially
urgent now during the coronavirus pandemic, so that governments, firms, civil
society organizations, and the general public can navigate, cope with, and
respond to the unprecedented impacts caused by this global pandemic.

In May 2020, the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) and the
[United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD)](https://unstats.un.org), in
coordination with the five United Nations Regional Commissions, initiated a
global online survey to assess the impact of the coronavirus crisis on
statistical offices and identify needs for financial and technical support. The
reports of the survey can be accessed here. The results provide useful
information for the global statistical community, donors, development partners,
and the general public to ensure that contingency plans and strategic decisions
are based on evidence and the actual needs of countries. This information helps
understand disruptions in national statistical activities, towards identifying
priorities for allocating resources and establishing technical cooperation in
the areas of greatest need.

This webinar will:

- Provide highlights of the survey results
- Present issues faced by national statistical offices and how they are
  overcoming them
- Showcase how partners have been utilizing survey results to support NSOs in
  COVID-19 response
